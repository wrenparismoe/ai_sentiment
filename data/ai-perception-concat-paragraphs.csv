''Programmers for computers are a dime a dozen, but what is needed are people who can take vaguely formed problems and find ways to make them precise enough to be programmed,'' Dr. Glymour added. ''This is what philosophers can do and they are planning a major role in artificial intelligence.'' ''For the past 40 years,'' he continued, ''American philosophy has been closely tied to the logical and mathematical study of knowledge and inference. The theories produced in these areas have been precise enough to be used in the design of artificial intelligence programs.'' As a result, Carnegie-Mellon six months ago began a program for a major called ''Logic and Computation,'' which involves studying the technical and theoretical issues in artificial intelligence.'' He pointed out that many leaders in the field of artificial intelligence have backgrounds in philosophy, with emphasis on logical thought. One is Dr. Herbert Simon of the Carnege Mellon faculty, who is a Nobel Prize winner. ''He took lots of philosophy,'' Dr. Glymour said last week. The major also requires a few courses in mathematics, including calculus, statistics, philosophy, linguistics, and psychology.

Does this satisfy the hunger of current interest? A pundit, to be helpful, must address Topic A before it becomes Topic Done to Death. An occasional change of pace is nice, but keeping ahead of the pace is what transforms ''night reading'' to first-thing-in-the-morning reading. 2. Does this divide the house? A column should take the fuzziness out of debate and show where a principle is at stake or a policy is wrongheaded or an outrage is being perpetuated or a promise broken. Let politicians temporize and voters agonize; the columnist should crystallize or polarize. 3. Does this put something new on the news agenda? Reporters are usually better reporters than thumbsuckers like to admit, but too often they are dispatched in packs. The column reader looks for the diamond in the trash can, the overlooked story, as well as the story to be alert for in weeks ahead - which pushes reporters to uncover it first, lest the Op-Ed page beat the front page, an embarrassment to all. 4. Where did he get this stuff? Most columnists have been around forever; the good ones use their time-tested sources, the bad ones let their sources use them. By reading a column over time, the shrewd reader spots who gets sent off and who gets sent up, and how often the pundit is mouthpiece or originator. 5. Does this guy have a point of view I can identify with, or at least reject with consistency? If a reader finds a pundit or two whose logic marches, whose premises do not waver, and who is unafraid to make judgments that cost him friends, then the reader can make use of the column in striking a judgment while the issue is hot. 6. Will I ever be surprised? Sometimes consistency is for hobgoblins; the same knee never jerks in exactly the same way. No political column should collapse into dreary expectability, because moods and mindsets change, and the reader is entitled to a little suspense in discovering where the pundit comes out. 7. Is this the product of a committee or a robot - or a flesh-and-blood individual with idiosyncracies and crotchets? In punditry, personality counts. The reader has to trust somebody in the opinion mafia, and an individual with a byline and a style is easier to love or hate than an institution.",In 750 Words,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.0,1.6666666666666667,  ,

Her achievement was all the greater because the Analytical Engine existed only on paper. Unlike Babbage's Difference Engine, it was never built. That her ''Notes'' amounted to a list of instructions to make the Analytical Engine perform and were, therefore, the world's first computer program was discovered by B. V.

4fd1781e8eb7c8105d66ef93,,Business,"''The Tomorrow Makers,'' by Grant Fjermedal ($18.95 from Macmillan) is a volume devoted to the furthest fringes of computer science, where the edges of reality and fantasy, of morality and amorality, of dreams and nightmares merge in a morass of maybes. The framework of the book is a voyage through the leading artificial intelligence and robotics laboratories, from Carnegie-Mellon to the University of Tokyo, where the reader will encounter various fascinating, wild-eyed, brilliant individuals engaged in mapping out the technological avenue to the future for humanity. Many of these researchers seem convinced that within a generation, or two at most, life will ''go on by creating computer copies of our minds and transferring, or downloading, that program into robotic bodies that never die.'' Life in such form, along with electronic protectors for mankind - effectively relieving us of any semblance of adult responsibility - is, according to these merry pranksters of artificial intelligence, humanity's only hope for survival in a supertech world. In their narcissistic search for immortality, these computer scientists seem to have abandoned all considerations of moral boundaries, to say nothing of the basic laws of thermodynamics. Apparently they are oblivious to the fact that we still cannot build even a car to last 10 years and they go on to dismiss the mind/body problem with an elegant amplification of the ''diskcopy'' command, which users of personal computers invoke to duplicate the data they have accumulated. Yet, technologically, the work of these scientists is often dazzling. TO counterbalance the hyperthyroid-propelled vision of ''The Tomorrow Makers,'' I would read Theodore Roszak's ''The Cult of Information'' ($7.95 from Pantheon Books). Mr. Roszak analyzes the folklore that envelops computers and the way in which it has glorified the machines by overstating their potential. Unfortunately, the book is flawed by the promulgation of a conspiracy among manufacturers, the media and the government to force society into the digital mold. Conspiracies are notoriously difficult to prove, and blaming the so-called computer revolution on such a plot makes about as much sense as accusing Bacon, Descartes, Galileo and their cohorts of conspiring to create the Age of Enlightenment. The author's left-leaning political views and technology-bashing bias also taint his thesis with partiality, although certainly they are no more prejudicial than the euphoric pro-technology fusillade fired off in ''The Tomorrow Makers.'' In fact, it is the very opposing nature of the obsessions the two books reveal that may suggest a point of equilibrium somewhere between the extremes. A crucial distinction is made by Mr. Roszak between information, or data, and knowledge, that semantic embarrassment which computer zealots at best ignore and at worst disguise, calling it by such misnomers as ''knowledge systems.'' Computers may excel at processing data. But, unlike humans, they are incapable of the original thought of which knowledge is created. The artificial intelligence community and, in fact, the entire computer cabal are nevertheless trying to mislead us into accepting the notion that the difference between the ''mind'' of the computer and the mind of man is merely a matter of degree, and that not only will this difference be eliminated in short order, but soon people will rank second to computers in their cognitive abilities and responsiveness.",HOW TO AVOID TUNNEL VISION,0,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,2,2,0,0,1,3,3.111111111111111,4.666666666666667,        AI minds are wildly different from human minds but creators do not comprehend this,   robotic immortality

Some of the setback stems from the failure of artificial intelligence to quickly live up to its promise of making machines that can understand English, recognize objects or reason like a human expert - to be used for such purposes as diagnosing machinery breakdowns or deciding whether to authorize a loan. Despite this, the technology is making slow but steady progress, and now is being subtly incorporated into more conventional computer programs. Weak Business Moves Far more of the artificial intelligence industry's problems result from poor business decisions by companies that were heavily weighted with technologists rather than business minds. Their main mistake was trying to use special computers for artificial intelligence; the machines were too expensive and did not mesh well with those used by potential customers. ''People believed their own hype,'' said S. Jerrold Kaplan, co-founder of one leading artificial intelligence company, Teknowledge Inc., and now president of the Go Corporation, a startup software company in San Francisco. ''Everyone was planning on growth that was unsustainable.'' Hardest hit in the retrenchment so far have been companies that sell special computers for use in artificial intelligence. Symbolics Inc. of Cambridge, Mass., the leader in that market, has had several quarters of heavy losses and recently ousted its chairman. Its archrival, Lisp Machine Inc., declared bankruptcy last year. Texas Instruments Inc. and the Xerox Corporation, the two other vendors in that market, are also experiencing sluggish sales. Meanwhile, Texas Instruments and Apple Computer Inc. announced yesterday that Texas Instruments would sell a version of the Macintosh containing the favored artificial intelligence programming language, Lisp. Still, while companies are suffering, artificial intelligence as a technology continues to make progress. Some companies that have adapted are still doing well. The Aion Corporation, a small, privately held company in Palo Alto, saw its sales triple last year, though from a tiny base. It sells tools that include artificial intelligence technology to help data processing employees develop programs for I.B.M. mainframes. The AI Corporation of Waltham, Mass., has successfully sold programs that allow corporate computer users to use English commands to retrieve information from data bases on I.B.M. mainframes. Use in General Software Artificial intelligence techniques are also being incorporated into general computer programs without necessarily being labeled as artificial intelligence. Symantec Inc. of Cupertino, Calif., sells a data base program for personal computers called Q & A that responds to English queries.

A.Computer scientists have been developing such microprocessor chips for several years. These chips are being designed to process a high-level computer programming language known as LISP, short for List Processing. The language is designed to enable a computer to mimic human perception and thinking processes, an application known as artificial intelligence. The new chips would replace the highly expensive artificial intelligence machines that have been designed to run LISP. Last week, Texas Instruments Inc. introduced the first version of a 32-bit microprocessor chip it has developed under a Defense Department contract. The 32-bit chip executes artificial intelligence programs more efficiently than the general-purpose devices. Motorola and Symbolics Inc. of Cambridge, Mass., are also working on similar artificial intelligence chips. The chips promise to lead to computers that are faster and cheaper in performing such tasks as understanding language and in emulating human experts in such tasks as diagnosing diseases and offering investment advice. Such computers could solve problems using word-like symbols that allow them to ''think'' like people. Using such expert systems, the computers could find solutions to complex problems based on a variety of humans experiences found in the programs.  Q.What causes blisters to form on the skin?  A.Blisters are usually caused by friction or burns. In friction, the upper layers (epidermis) of the skin move back and forth over the lower layers (dermis), until a small cleft is produced between the layers of skin. Fluid collects in the cleft. When the skin is burned, serum from damaged blood vessels collects between the epidermis and the dermis.

Charges of insider trading at Morgan Stanley and bribery at McDonnell Douglas are among the cases portrayed in James B. Stewart's book about government prosecutors. ''Each of the stories unfolds with the suspense of a terrific detective novel, but the book is even better than that because the stories are true,'' Seymour Wishman said in The Book Review last year.  THE WORLD AS I FOUND IT, by Bruce Duffy. (Ticknor & Fields, $8.95.) During his early days at Cambridge, arguing logic with Bertrand Russell, it seemed that Ludwig Wittgenstein was the ultimate system builder, attempting in his book ''Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus'' to delineate the geometries of language and life. But somewhere along the way, the philosopher had a change of heart. The ''sweeping arrangement of fact and fancy'' in Bruce Duffy's novel about this enigmatic man ''is vivid, passionate and funny,'' Perry Meisel said here last year. ''Mr. Duffy's is an achievement in both fiction and historiography which deepens Wittgenstein's mythology and should attract a wider audience to it.''  THE TOXIC CLOUD, by Michael H. Brown.

However, three decades later computers still do not think. Is this because of the technological failings of the computer industry? Or is artificial intelligence theoretically impossible? Finally, since most of the research is financed by the Pentagon, will smarter computers lead to more efficient ways of killing people? Three reports follow. With awards and contracts to universities, private companies and Government agencies, the project is financing work not only in artificial intelligence, but also in computer vision and speech recognition and in programs that would allow computers to recognize English. The greatest achievement so far has not been in artificial intelligence but in large-scale parallel computing, Dr. Schwartz said. Conventional computers use a single processing chip to solve problems one step at a time. By using numerous processors, a computer can simultaneously work on different parts of a problem, reducing the time it takes to solve it. ''The success of work like this justifies the investment,'' Dr. Schwartz said. ''American companies are ahead in parallel processing, with a number of machines available on the market now. We're getting ready for computers performing at levels 100 times larger than the largest present supercomputer.''

The quest to make computers ''think'' turned instead to artificial intelligence, which involves programming rules into a computer for performing tasks such as reading aloud or making medical diagnoses. A rule for reading out loud, for instance, might be to pronounce a ''k'' except when it is followed by an ''n,'' in which case it is silent.

An Adept robot had placed chips on a printed circuit board within three-thousandths of an inch of specifications. A major source of that challenge has been the failure of robotics to live up to its advance notices in the early 1980's, when it was touted as the industry of the future and the best hope for reviving America's manufacturing sector. Many of the robots - computer-driven machine tools flexible enough to handle a variety of parts and tasks - turned out to be less accurate, less flexible, weaker or slower than promised. And even when they worked, the robots often did not mesh well with the rest of the manufacturing process.

The current effort concentrates on new designs involving parallel processing, but future advances could even involve bioengineering, according to a third essay by Michael Edelhart, the editor of P.C.

Just a few years ago, the phrase ''expert system'' conjured up images of programs that could make computers reason, converse and learn like the humans whose knowledge they seek to replicate. More than a few struggling software companies nurtured that image: programs that could ''think,'' even in a limited way, were always just a few years away from becoming a commercial product. ''In the future artificial intelligence should simulate easily replaceable people,'' said Roger C. Schank, a professor of computer science and psychology at Yale University who also heads a fledgling artificial-intelligence company, Cognitive Systems. ''For example, there are a lot of people in the customer-service area - bank tellers, travel agents, airline reservation clerks - who don't do their job very well.'' And they are the kind of people who, programmers hope, they will soon learn to simulate. Actually writing such a program, computer experts note, would not be all that difficult. Most of the decisions made by banks are strictly ''rule-based,'' the industry's lingo for actions that follow a closely prescribed set of guidelines. And rules are the lifeblood of any expert system. Usually, they are expressed as a series of ''if-then'' statements: If the patient complains of stomachaches, then what has she eaten? If the robot has stopped operating, then check its power supply. ''A library of cases should be what characterizes the intelligence of a machine,'' contends Professor Schank, who like many in the field questions whether the current generation of expert systems has very much to do with the goal of creating artificial intelligence.

People were either reductionists, who believed that the brain is a biological machine - a system of neurological gears and pulleys that can be mimicked by a computer - or holists, who insisted that there is some indescribable mind stuff that will slip through the cracks of any simulation. No matter how sophisticated its cogitations, these holists would say, a computer will never have intuition, wisdom or - some have even called it - soul. Like oil and water, the two positions are immiscible; holism and reductionism just don't mix. With both artificial intelligence programs and neural networks the goal is to create intelligence outside the body and learn more about how the mind works. But in artificial intelligence it has been assumed that the brain's psychology can be simulated from the top down without paying much attention to the way neurons work. The neural network people take a bottom-up approach: they assemble a network of artificial neurons and hope that a mind will emerge. The neural net enthusiasts are as far from their goal of making intelligent machines as are their competitors in artificial intelligence. But for some reason people who have reviled the artificial intelligentsia, as they like to call them, are suddenly embracing neural networks. The philosopher Hubert Dreyfus has made his career using obscure arguments from Heidegger and other philosophers to denounce artificial intelligence as theoretically impossible. But he was so impressed by neural nets that he rewrote parts of his 1985 book ''Mind Over Machine'' (written with his brother, Stuart Dreyfus), allowing that thinking machinery might not be so unthinkable after all. It is surprising that as good a science writer as Mr. Campbell would fall into this same confusion, believing that neural nets constitute ''an approach that is radically different from much of the Western philosophical tradition.'' His first book, ''Grammatical Man,'' was an exhilarating meditation on information and entropy, order and chaos - the poles of the dynamo that generates life. ''The Improbable Machine'' elegantly describes the importance of neural networks in studying the brain-mind connection. But in trying to make neural nets seem like an upheaval rather than a variation on a theme, he turns artificial intelligence into a caricature that few of its adherents would recognize. In Mr. Campbell's mythology, the neural net people were clever enough to see through this ruse. Unlike standard digital computers, brains consist of billions of processors - the neurons - that operate in parallel. What is more, people are inherently illogical. We overgeneralize and jump to conclusions. But in our weakness lies our strength. We can tolerate ambiguity and deal with imperfect information. In the 1960's, the neural net researchers were bullied out of the laboratory by the artificial intelligentsia, he argues, but now, two decades later, artificial intelligence has failed and neural nets are making a comeback.",Casting Their Neural Nets,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,2.8666666666666663,4.733333333333333,"  philosophical conflict within AI field, soullessness of AI  philosophical conflict within AI field   AI has bad reputation       ",     AI research       neural nets

A T.O.E. would bring new depths of understanding to every basic process in nature, from the death of stars to the birth of the universe. It would, however, be a reductionist theory, concerned principally with simple interactions and far removed from such complicated phenomena as life and thought. And yet we find similar optimism at the complex end of the spectrum, too. Many mathematicians working in computer science propose that it will soon be possible to build computers capable of artificial intelligence, machines that could equal or excel the thought processes of the human mind.

However, three decades later computers still do not think. Is this because of the technological failings of the computer industry? Or is artificial intelligence theoretically impossible? Finally, since most of the research is financed by the Pentagon, will smarter computers lead to more efficient ways of killing people? Three reports follow. In the last few years, such optimism has gradually faded. Bringing the visionary technologies of artificial intelligence to the market has proved far more difficult than had been anticipated. Many of the original artificial-intelligence companies - including Teknowledge, Intellicorp, the Carnegie Group and the Inference Corporation - have suffered losses. Several others have gone out of business. Progress in building intelligent machines is also coming from a new group of researchers who are attempting to merge neurobiology and semiconductor manufacturing technology. In the past most developments in artificial intelligence have been in the software rather than in the hardware; whatever intelligence there was existed in the programs not in the machines.

After spending a season observing the big leagues, the New York Times book critic Christopher Lehmann-Haupt contemplated the uneasy relationship between those who play baseball and those who sit in the press box and write about it. ''Seldom is the awkwardness of this situation so freshly and unabashedly reflected as in this book,'' Roy Blount Jr. said in The Times in 1986.  STARING AT THE SUN, by Julian Barnes. (Perennial/ Harper & Row, $7.95.) On the eve of her 100th birthday, in 2021, an Englishwoman named Jean Serjeant, who once left a ''second-rate life'' with a boring husband to seek enchantment and the wonders of the world, boards an airplane and flies into the sun. Last year our reviewer, Carlos Fuentes, called the novel ''a marvelous literary epiphany'' and praised Julian Barnes, the author of ''Flaubert's Parrot,'' for using his ''great precision of language, ironical detachment and talent for the incarnation of ideas'' to let his readers ''witness a reality we do not normally see.''  TANIA: A Biography and Memoir of Isak Dinesen, by Parmenia Migel. (McGraw-Hill, $8.95.) Karen Blixen's nom de plume was Isak Dinesen, but to her friends she was Titania - Tania for short. In 1967, when this memoir by Parmenia Migel was first published, our reviewer, William Jay Smith, called it ''a remarkably sensitive book that . . . never for one moment loses sight of  [ Dinesen's ]  magic. . . . Miss Migel has told Tania's own story as she would have wished it told, with accuracy and care, with wit and style.''  WHO KILLED PALOMINO MOLERO? by Mario Vargas Llosa. Translated by Alfred Mac Adam. (Collier/ Macmillan, $6.95.) The Peruvian novelist Mario Vargas Llosa uses a detective story about the murder of a young singer to explore the ambiguities of truth, justice and evil. ''Evoking landscape and mores in writing that is spare, rich and cruelly beautiful, he both satisfies the requirements of the genre and demonstrates that it too can resonate like any other form of fiction,'' Richard Lourie said in The Book Review last year.  THE NEW AMERICAN GRANDPARENT: A Place in the Family, a Life Apart, by Andrew J. Cherlin and Frank F. Furstenberg Jr. (Basic Books, $9.95.) Increased longevity and the ever-advancing demographic bulge are creating a country that is top-heavy with grandparents, who are providing their children's children with something halfway between a parental authority figure and an aging friend. In 1986 Maggie Scarf said here that this sociological study is ''a bit dry in places,'' but that it provides a ''comprehensive and intriguing portrait of grandparenting in America today.''  A NIGHT AT THE MOVIES: Or, You Must Remember This, by Robert Coover. (Collier/Macmillan, $7.95.) Written in the form of absurd cinematic parodies, Robert Coover's collection of short fiction shows that the printed page can be more malleable to the imagination than the silver screen. ''The book gives us a long, exhilarating evening at an old-fashioned movie palace,'' Edmund White said here last year. ''Mr. Coover has understood the potential of the movies to persuade and to subvert but also to go out of control.''  THE CAPTIVE PUBLIC: How Mass Opinion Promotes State Power, by Benjamin Ginsberg. (Basic Books, $8.95.) By managing mass opinion, Benjamin Ginsberg writes, governments use democracy as a means of social control. Last year our reviewer, Mark Crispin Miller, said the author's ''quasi-Orwellian vision is oversimple,'' but he found the book ''largely admirable.''  OVERHEAD IN A BALLOON: Twelve Stories of Paris, by Mavis Gallant. (Norton, $7.95.) When these interlocking stories by the Canadian writer were published last year, Phyllis Rose said in these pages that Mavis Gallant ''conjures up  [ Paris ]  more knowingly than any other fiction writer in English. . . . In the taut, high-wire literary performances in this volume,  [ she ]  is at the top of her form.''  A GOOD ENOUGH PARENT: A Book on Child-Rearing, by Bruno Bettelheim. (Vintage, $9.95.) Last year our reviewer, Barbara Ehrenreich, said she wondered how Bruno Bettelheim thought today's two-paycheck families would have time for his leisurely, permissive approach to child raising. But she found the book ''a reassuring corrective to the hubris that leads many parents to think they can mold a child to meet their exact specifications.''  SERENISSIMA, by Erica Jong. (Dell, $4.95.) An intellectual American actress travels to the 16th century and has a lurid affair with William Shakespeare. In 1987 Michael Malone said in The Book Review that he didn't like this novel as much as he did ''Fanny,'' but he praised Erica Jong for ''her careful research, her rich descriptive facility and her deep love of the period.''  THE TOMORROW MAKERS: A Brave New World of Living-Brain Machines, by Grant Fjermedal. (Tempus, $8.95.) If the mind is a program, theoretically it can be ''downloaded,'' or fed, into computerized robots, granting a kind of immortality. Last year one reviewer said this book about computer scientists and robotics is ''a virtual smorgasbord of artificial intelligence.''  MEMOIRS OF MANY IN ONE, by Alex Xenophon Demirjian Gray. Edited by Patrick White. (Penguin, $6.95.) A madwoman's fantasies, cast as a memoir edited by the author, allow Patrick White to write a story about writing stories.

Well, naturally, because the robot is trying to swerve into people's offices - for example, into the office of Kaigham J. Gabriel, in the machine perception research department of A.T.&T. Bell Laboratories in New Jersey. Gabriel has enough troubles. He is trying to put across the bewildering idea that in the future, robots tiny enough to clean out your clogged heart arteries from the inside will have special control problems because they won't have any mass or inertia to speak of. Soldo's robot, meanwhile, has solved its own control problem. It reaches the end of the corridor and, without hesitating perceptibly, turns left and coolly trundles off. It is an uninspiring sort of robot, really - just a small cart with wheels. Out the window, a human can see that nature has provided a fine autumn day, sunshine and a brisk wind playing over sculpted green gardens. The robot's television-camera eye reduces this vista to vague white-on-black lines. The robot is not using the camera for navigation anyway. It is using sonar, and, because of all the smooth metal and glass surfaces around, trying to navigate by reflected sound is like trying to figure out where you are in a hall of mirrors. Sometimes the robot gets confused. Who wouldn't? Confused? As the era of robots dawns - and it is dawning with a vengeance - people are finding it all too easy to apply such words to the mental states of inanimate objects. Scientists who make humanlike machines are falling into the obvious anthropomorphic traps, ascribing thoughts and emotions to their creations, if only for the sake of linguistic convenience. Soldo's robot sometimes gets ''confused'' when people walk by. It freezes into a catatonic state or else it nervously hugs the wall and keeps going. Soldo, who is a graduate-student researcher, shouts at her robot, though she knows full well that this model cannot hear her - it is not equipped for voice recognition. Down the hall, Russell Andersson has a robot that plays Ping-Pong. It is more nimble and clever than Soldo's. Andersson says that to solve the Ping-Pong problem he had to endow his robot with a sense of time and a sense of self-awareness. So they are tackling the vision problem, the navigation problem, the manipulation problem. Unlike industrial robots, stuck in their mindless ruts, the robots in these research laboratories look around, clamber over obstacles, pick out objects from piles of junk and manipulate them with fingers covered in plastic skin. Some of the progress is painfully slow. Robot designers admit that their field, like artificial intelligence, is suffering the consequences of the last decade's hype. Even so, some developments are startling: robots play Ping-Pong and billiards. An Australian robot shears sheep quite well (though enthusiasm was tempered by an early ovine fatality). Robot senses now include vision, hearing and touch. Robot hands are getting dexterous: the so-called Stanford-J.P.L. (Jet Propulsion Laboratory) hand can pick up wine glasses with its individually coordinated fingers; the Utah-M.I.T. hand can grasp an egg, crack it, dump its contents into a bowl, and then beat it at high speed with its index finger.

However, three decades later computers still do not think. Is this because of the technological failings of the computer industry? Or is artificial intelligence theoretically impossible? Finally, since most of the research is financed by the Pentagon, will smarter computers lead to more efficient ways of killing people? Three reports follow. WHILE many scientists question whether people are smart enough to make machines that think, few of them doubt that artificial intelligence is at least theoretically possible. Hubert Dreyfus, a colleague of Dr. Searle's, argues that artificial intelligence is impossible because reality itself cannot be formalized. Since the days of Plato, he believes, we have been deluded into believing that everything can be modeled by abstract systems. Whether we use mathematics to describe an economy, or quantum theory to describe an atom, something essential will always slip through the cracks of our simulations.

Mr. Moravec's whole thesis presumes that sufficiently advanced computers and robots will possess consciousness in the same sense we do; otherwise, how could they become our heirs? And yet, except to say that consciousness will be ''emergent'' in complex systems, he does little to justify this presumption. In fact, it has been the subject of many a debate among philosophers, psychologists and artificial intelligence researchers: is thought just a form of (very complex) information processing? I happen to believe it is. But there are a lot of deep issues here, and I think ''Mind Children'' would have been stronger with a much better discussion of them. Leaving that issue aside, however, we still have the second basic question: is Mr. Moravec's vision of the future desirable? And here, I think, he falters. Nowhere in ''Mind Children'' does he express the slightest doubt that what can be done will be done. (Indeed, he argues that nations will be forced to develop robots as fast as possible in the name of economic competitiveness.) He says very little about the impact of humanlike robots on human employment - or, more importantly, on humankind's sense of purpose and dignity. Apparently we are simply to fade away, leaving the universe to our heirs and betters. And he gives only passing mention to that ancient human institution, warfare.

4fd1a02d8eb7c8105d6b46c7,,Technology; Business,"Sun also signed a significant pact last week with Texas Instruments. Texas Instruments' chip-manufacturing division, which includes some of the biggest and most sophisticated fabrication facilities in this country, agreed to make SPARC chips for Sun and other customers. Texas Instruments' computer systems group, at the same time, licensed the SPARC chip for use in a new line of Unix-based computer systems that company officials said would incorporate artificial intelligence features now found on the company's more expensive and specialized Explorer platform. ''T.I.'s great failing has been in commercial systems,'' said Richard A. Shaffer, editor and publisher of the Technologic Computer Letter. ''They don't have a part of the microprocessor market. None of their chips has made it, at least not in mainstream microprocessors. This is another shot at the market they lost to Motorola.'' Texas Instruments has also not had a successful business computer. It wants to change that by building a Unix-standard work station around the SPARC chip, customizing it to take advantage of symbolic processing, and thus provide it with special artificial intelligence features. By customizing the SPARC design with its own artificial intelligence techniques in a Unix-based machine, the company hopes to make artificial intelligence and expert systems cost-effective for large-scale operations. TEXAS INSTRUMENTS currently provides such a system, the Explorer, at a cost of $50,000 to $100,000 for each user. Its recently announced Microexplorer system brings some artificial intelligence functions down to about $10,000 a user.But with the SPARC architecture in a standard Unix work station, Texas Instruments hopes to bring such expert-system technology to thousands of users at a cost of perhaps $2,000 a user.

4fd1a51e8eb7c8105d6be15e,,Arts; Books,"In ''The Age of Intelligent Machines,'' Mr. Kurzweil valiantly attempts to provide an overview of artificial intelligence - the field devoted to the theory, design and construction of computing machines that think, or at least appear to. He discusses its philosophical, mathematical, psychological and technical roots; the outstanding problems in contemporary research on artificial intelligence; the history and current state of the industry; the impact of artificial intelligence on the arts, and the future of the discipline. The volume is an innovative blend of monograph and anthology, for it includes not only Mr. Kurzweil's own writing but a number of essays by philosophers and researchers in artificial intelligence. This structure would have been more successful, however, if the author had included views divergent from his own alongside those that buttress his position. On his own turf Mr. Kurzweil is clear, current and informative. He understands how artificial intelligence can be used in pattern recognition, reading, speech and music synthesis. But when he strays into philosophy, logic and psychology, he is often sloppy and vague. He relies on dated and secondary sources, ignores or misunderstands many of the most important thinkers and distorts the relevant history of philosophy and logic. Mr. Kurzweil also is too quick to draw inferences about human psychology from artificial intelligence models, and he is superficial when he discusses one of the most exciting developments in current artificial intelligence theory - the emergence of connectionism, which explains intelligence as arising from a web of interconnected, individually very simple, processes. Mr. Kurzweil's enthusiasm for the artificial intelligence industry also leads him to disregard his own advice against overly optimistic projection as well as his own remarks on the deep differences between human and machine intelligence. While noting that ''understanding language can . . . require a knowledge of history, myths, literary allusions and references, and many other categories of shared human experience,'' he says on the same page that Terry Winograd's 1970 Shrdlu program (an early attempt, later repudiated by its designer, to model language comprehension) represents progress toward a genuine understanding of natural language, and he asserts that ''we can expect translating telephones with reasonable levels of performance . . . early in the first decade of the next century.'' There is no suggestion of the mammoth difficulties that confront anyone who tries to accomplish such a task. Chess is a leitmotif in the history of artificial intelligence, and in this book. Mr. Kurzweil writes that ''when a computer does become the chess champion . . . before the end of the century, we will either think more of computers, less of ourselves, or less of chess.'' But then he undermines this odd speculation by observing correctly that the methods by which computers play chess differ dramatically from those by which humans play. This difference is evidenced by the fact that even though humans can play go (a Japanese board game) with no greater difficulty than chess, computers, which can play chess extremely well, are embarrassingly weak at go. In other words, the fact that planes and birds fly makes us think neither more nor less of birds, planes or flight. Bird flight and plane flight are simply two quite different feats. Artificial intelligence boosters and critics are often puzzled by one another, and often talk past one another. Mr. Kurzweil has heard the voices on the other side, but he has not quite understood the force of their arguments or the problems they pose. Even sympathetic critics of artificial intelligence look like Luddites to him. But, after all, judicious Luddism may not be such a bad thing.","Machine See, Machine Do",2,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,3,0,1,2.8666666666666667,4.666666666666667,           being beaten by computer diminishes humans   references Luddites as wisely cautious," AI's use in arts   can be used in pattern recognition, reading, speech and music synthesis     can play games like chess and go     "

A brilliant polymath, Mr. Simon is a Nobel laureate in economics, a pioneer in political science, psychology and management and a founding father of artificial intelligence, the enterprise of trying to build machines that think. Now he has turned to autobiography and thus provides a window onto the subjective side of scientific achievement. Models of My Life, one of the books in the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation series, offers dramatic examples of science as the product of the whole scientist, of the fit among personality, scientific problems and strategies for their solution. As the work comes out of the life, so the life is shaped by the work. And while readers may come to this book thinking that artificial intelligence is an impersonal product of technological progress, they will come away seeing that it is a deeply personal enterprise -- an expression of the esthetic of the people who work in it and, more than that, a science of self-reflection, a way of thinking about one's own thought. In the mid-1950's, Mr. Simon married his vision of human behavior to the possibilities offered by computer technology. The computer gave powerful expression to Mr. Simon's already-formed intellectual esthetic. His idea that humans solve problems under constraint was easily adapted to the task of programming a computer to solve problems using heuristic search -- a procedure that doesn't involve absolute rules but rules of thumb based on the knowledge of specific and bounded environments. And his idea that observation must be the foundation for abstraction led him to create a research strategy for artificial intelligence that he called ""thinking aloud."" In ""thinking aloud,"" Mr. Simon and his colleagues asked people to express their thoughts as they solved logical problems, and then they analyzed the transcripts of these sessions. The protocols of human beings playing games and solving puzzles were used to evaluate computer programs made to follow in human footsteps. Whereas some artificial intelligence researchers were content to leave aside the larger question of whether machines that perform intelligent tasks are doing them in the way people might, Mr. Simon took a very different tack. His artificial intelligence was psychology, not engineering. From the first, he says, ""we were interested in simulating    human problem solving,    and not simply in demonstrating how computers could solve hard problems."" His school of artificial intelligence was committed to the view that human intelligence is the manipulation of symbols and the implementation of rules.

Two video cameras take snapshots of the robot arms in every position relative to an object and, through extensive repetition, the robot begins to associate positions of the arm and the object with the movement it has just made. Over time, it begins to develop its own sense of the motion needed to carry out a particular task in the space that it has explored.

The project is being directed from NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center here. On Thursday, the center accomplished another goal of the project by taking control of the robot through a satellite link and operating its cameras as it sat on the crater rim. Planning for the Planets The Dante mission is seeking not only to give volcanology a valuable new tool but also to prove the concept of robotic exploration of the Moon and Mars. When the robot is under the control of Goddard, there is a lag of 2.5 seconds each way in communicating with the robot, similar to the delay in operating a robot on the Moon from the Earth. Dante, a spider-like contraption weighing almost 1,000 pounds, was built by a team at Carnegie-Mellon University's Robotics Institute in Pittsburgh. The project took less than a year from concept to putting the robot on the mountain because the institute used much existing technology in constructing the machine. The robot, which is 9.8-feet long and 5.6-feet wide with a center mast that makes it 8.2-feet high, moves at a maximum speed of 6.6 feet a minute. Rappelling to the Lava Lake Dante is designed to rappel down the volcano with the help of a tether that is unreeled from its transport vehicle on the rim. At the lava lake, the robot is to take temperature readings, measure the composition of gases escaping from volcanic vents and retrieve samples of aerosols and the powdery mineral substances that build up around vent holes.  The Antarctic research team, including volcano experts from the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology, wants Dante to spend at least a day near the lake before starting back up the crater. Constructed mainly of aluminum alloy and titanium, Dante is to feel its way down the crater walls with the help of a laser range-finder that has a 350-degree field of view. Developers of the range-finder said it tells the robot where objects are in every direction. In addition, the robot has six video cameras mounted on its center mast, three looking forward and three behind, that combine images to give the three-dimensional views of the surroundings.","On Lonely Mission, Robot Starts Descent Into Volcano",0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.611111111111111,3.944444444444444,                 ,"space exploration      does dangerous jobs       exploration, research Where humans cannot tread, the robot is to take temperature readings, measure the composition of gases escaping from volcanic vents and retrieve samples of aerosols and the powdery mineral substances that build up around vent holes.   does dangerous jobs"

If scientists could never agree, they didn't seem to mind. But business people are pressing to redefine success in artificial intelligence. But even if computers still cannot think, artificial intelligence is making them smarter. Some large companies are using A.I. software that makes decisions by searching data for patterns, following rules of thumb and drawing on experience stored in memory. These programs allow American Express Company computers, for example, to analyze credit status and account activity and then decide whether to authorize a credit card charge. Another large user, Northwest Airlines, can audit millions of tickets and decide whether the right taxes, commissions and fares were paid. Many share the belief of Joe Carter, a partner in Anderson Consulting, one of the nation's largest international management and technology consulting firms, that the development of artificial intelligence is overly dependent on the goal of matching human thinking. Saying as much in his speech, Mr. Carter set the room abuzz with vexation. It's time to recycle the A.I. acronym -- there's nothing artificial about the intelligence in the systems we build, he added. ""We don't need any more artificial humans, but we need vast improvements in alternatives to human intelligence."" Some of what you say is dangerous to the field of artificial intelligence, said Stuart Shapiro, a professor at the State University of New York at Buffalo, rising to answer Mr. Carter.

Because computers have made their way into nearly every corner of our lives, the professionals who design computers may unwittingly possess as much control over our future as elected officials. Yet students preparing for careers in computer and software development often receive little - or no - instruction in the ethical problems they will create. Two Australians, Tom Forester, who teaches at the School of Computing and Information Technology at Griffith University in Queensland, and Perry Morrison, a lecturer in computing at the University of New England in New South Wales, offer a provocative look into the moral issues surrounding the world's most powerful machines. ''We argue,'' they write in ''Computer Ethics,'' ''that computer systems by their very nature are insecure, unreliable and unpredictable - and that society has yet to come to terms with the consequences.'' Computer crime could cost each of the top 300 companies in the United States $2 million to $10 million a year, they write, but only 35 percent of I.B.M. mainframes used security software by late 1988.

Perhaps even more frightening is the 10-year delay in warnings about ozone depletion; software employed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration called satellite ozone measurements spurious because they were so low.

His table of contents resembles a college catalogue, with sections on the physical sciences, the social sciences, mathematics, the arts, philosophy and religion. Miraculously, his ambition does not exceed his erudition; the same reasonable, trustworthy voice examines artificial intelligence and ''Alice's Adventures in Wonderland,'' pragmatist philosophy and supply-side economics. Mr. Gardner acts as a journalist of ideas, absorbing the most difficult theories of quantum physics and philosophy and restating them for us in jargon-free language. His essays, collected mainly from Scientific American and The New York Review of Books, exhibit a singular love of discovery; he appears impatient to learn what new truths science may uncover. Mr. Gardner sees the world as a puzzle to be solved, the ultimate brain teaser fabricated by God for our (or His) awe and amusement. So he never shies away from the big questions: Why does the universe exist? Do humans possess free will? Is there a God? These essays serve as his own explorations into the subject matter; he does not set out to convince or cajole. He takes special glee in chiding intellectuals who abandon their common sense.

He was so transfixed by the vivid green and orange toy robot, which looked like a blank-eyed Martian, that he willingly paid $12 for it. ''The price seemed high to me at the time,'' he said. ''So I didn't tell my wife, Karen, what I'd paid for it.'' He quickly discovered that the robot, called the Interplanetary Explorer Spaceman, was worth about $1,000. But recently, Mr. Wyse said, dealers and collectors had identified robots that were made exclusively for the Japanese. The one he acquired was a walking robot with sparkling eyes and a cone-shaped head. He paid only $3,000 for it, in part, because it came without its original box. With the box, as with most such toys, the robot would probably have cost twice as much. The rarest of these toys, Machine Man, first attracted collectors in the late 1980's. Only one was known at the time, but since then several others have come to light, including one Mr. Wyse bought last year. While he refused to say how much he paid for it, he said it was the most expensive robot he had ever bought. Mr. Bergin, who sold it to Mr. Wyse, said he knew of several private sales of robots for more than $20,000 each.

Steven Pinker, a professor of psychology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, is one of the clearest writers about this new synthesis. ''How the Mind Works'' examines brain mechanisms -- or rather, computational models of brain mechanisms -- and the evolution of our reasoning abilities, emotions and social and sexual behavior. The marriage is by no means complete; Pinker exaggerates when he says that ''without the computational theory, it is impossible to make sense of the evolution of the mind.'' I suspect the evolutionary insights in the book would have made good sense to that precomputational Victorian Charles Darwin. However, there is still a strong unity in this book. The computational and evolutionary parts, for instance, both reject the idea that the mind begins life, in Locke's phrase, as a sheet of blank paper. Artificial intelligence is a powerful test; it requires you not merely to talk about how a mental task is accomplished, but to write a program to prove it. If you program a robot as initially blank except for a general learning rule or two (I mean something like the psychologist's ''law of association'': the robot should do more of whatever it has associated with pleasurable, or reinforcing, consequences), it will not develop much of a mind. It fails because the environment contains too many stimuli, and each action has too many possible consequences. Unless the robot has been programmed to recognize which stimuli to concentrate on and how to assess them, it is hopeless at human tasks. Indeed, for many tasks, including walking or holding or reading a newspaper, the robot will be hopeless even if it contains state-of-the-art software. Humans find them easy enough in practice, but the rocket scientists are baffled about how we manage them in theory. As for walking, ''no one has yet figured out how we do it.'' When you hold up your arm, your brain is ''solving a near-intractable physics problem.'' When you use your eyes, you solve ''what engineers call an 'ill-posed problem.' It literally has no solution.'' Pinker adds, ''I believe that the discovery by cognitive science and artificial intelligence of the technical challenges overcome by our mundane mental activity is one of the great revelations of science, an awakening of the imagination comparable to learning that the universe is made up of billions of galaxies or that a drop of pond water teems with microscopic life.'' He concludes that the mind must possess a set of specialized, preprogrammed modules that are quite unlike one another, each designed for a task such as perception or social exchange.",The Brain's Software,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,3.111111111111111,4.444444444444444,        ,        provides insight into wonder of the brain

Scientists initially thought the problems they experienced were with a computer at the expedition base station 1.4 miles down the mountain. But today they discovered that the fiber optics communications cable to the robot had had kinks in it as it unreeled and that one of them had resulted in a break. The communications cable, through which the robot received its commands and sent back television images and data, was a crucial component in the mission for which there was no backup, they said. When the robot was under Goddard's control, there was a lag time of 2.5 seconds each way in the communications, similar to the delay in operating a robot on the Moon from the Earth.  NASA had hoped that the Dante expedition would give it experience in operating more advanced robots on the Moon and other planets. Mr. Osborn said the attempt to send the 1,000-pound robot into Mount Erebus was canceled when engineers realized the the glass-fiber communications cable could not be repaired at the site or at the nearby American Antarctic base at McMurdo. Any repair or replacement was at least seven days away, he said, and that was too long because the project had to be off the mountain by mid-January.",Scientists Call Off Robot's Mission Into Volcano,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.8,3.8," robots break down    technical problems      there was a lag time of 2.5 seconds each way in the communications, similar to the delay in operating a robot on the Moon from the Earth.

In the opening pages, a covert Government agent remarks to his talking computer: ''You know that I think artificial intelligence is the key to winning the wars of the future. The key to colonizing the planets. The key to everything.'' The missing ingredient in creating a ''truly conscious computer,'' the agent believes, can be found in the human ability to dream. Closest to making a key discovery in this field is a brilliant young scientist, Jody Nightwood, director of a sleep clinic and a subject of her own research into dreaming. A red-haired shaman-in-training, Jody theorizes that the dream experience is real, occurring in a dimension that can be charted, quantified and simulated. The covert agent and his archrival both attempt to infiltrate her life and steal her findings. Awake, Jody is romanced by a tall, shadowy figure named -- you guessed it -- Shade. Asleep, she romps with a dream lover called Ish.

In ""Brainmakers: How Scientists Are Moving Beyond Computers to Create a Rival to the Human Brain,"" a Boston-based science writer, David Freedman, sets out to survey the current state of the art of artificial intelligence. His premise is that the original artificial intelligence researchers, traditionalists as he refers to them, failed because their attempts to codify a logic representing human thought proved bankrupt. Elaborate models written in computer languages such as Lisp and Prolog were incapable of emulating the simplest kinds of human behavior. Mr. Freedman then charts the outlines of a new movement that has emerged to carry the search for artificial intelligence forward by drawing on the biological underpinnings of human intelligence. It is a seductive idea: a new artificial intelligence revolution can be achieved by copying the simplest biological processes and enhancing those processes with immensely powerful supercomputers and arrays of neural circuits made in the laboratory. Indeed, even while Mr. Freedman draws disparaging portraits of such pioneers in artificial intelligence as Marvin Minsky and Seymour Papert, computer scientists at M.I.T., and John McCarthy of Stanford (who is described as looking and acting like a homeless person), his more affectionate portraits of the younger artificial life wizards contain enough ominous signs to warn the reader that this new generation is no closer to the holy grail of a self-conscious machine. But in a brief conclusion Mr. Freedman writes, ""The nature-based A.I. movement seems exceptionally well positioned to succeed."" Yet in the following paragraph he admits, ""On the other hand, conventional A.I. also got off to a breathtaking start . . . It wasn't for nearly two decades that the endeavor began to lose momentum.""

Computers will soon become ''smarter than us,'' the supercomputer designer Danny Hillis asserted in a Newsweek essay. Actually the contest, whatever its outcome, only underscores what a flop artificial intelligence has been, especially relative to its founders' goals. The naivete of Marvin Minsky of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and other pioneers in the field is legendary. In 1966 Professor Minsky gave an undergraduate, Gerald Sussman, the task of building an object-recognition device out of a computer and a television. Object recognition is what you do when you're having lunch with a prospective employer and you suddenly realize that the person at the next table with his back to you is your current employer.

Mr. Trefil, who teaches physics at George Mason University, methodically attempts in ''Are We Unique?'' to prove that the boundaries separating humankind from animals and machines are fundamentally inviolable. He uses cogent examples from evolutionary biology, psychology, computer science, philosophy and the new science of complexity to illustrate his arguments, and he personalizes abstract scientific concepts with deft analogies and anecdotes, like his account of how he courted his wife: ''We were in a restaurant in Chicago, and when I looked at her across the table I knew, with more certainty than I've ever known anything in physics or mathematics, that I was in love with this woman.'' Proponents of artificial intelligence, he continues, ''are going to have to work very hard to convince me that an algorithm running on a Turing machine is ever going to know anything in quite that way.'' Although Mr. Trefil makes a solid scientific case for humanity's uniqueness, it is his insightful, witty, informal -- in a word, human -- style that convinces the reader that no machine could ever succeed in replacing such an author or in duplicating such a book.

When it sees a good candidate, the robot will move in for detailed examination with instruments on the end of a movable arm, including a close-up mini-camera that will look at it from different angles. Nomad will touch the rock several times with a reflection spectrometer, which shines a light on the object and analyzes the spectrum of the reflected light to tell what elements are present. Then the robot will use a metal detector to sense the presence of iron, a major component of some meteorites, and do computations to classify the sample. If Nomad decides a rock is a meteorite, the robot will radio the object's exact location to the researchers using coordinates calculated by the satellite-based Global Positioning System.

As lovers of the legendary British comedy troupe Monty Python's Flying Circus can attest, Idle is one of the least robotic men ever to wield the unspeakable power of the Comfy Chair, an inspired buffoon whose prissy, leering face and lunatic antics helped drive some of the best comedy of the past three decades. Yet in print he clanks dutifully along like a humanoid who needs a battery recharge. It isn't that Idle isn't smart. ''The Road to Mars,'' an offbeat futuristic thriller- comedy about the misadventures of two small-time comedians and their faithful robot on an interplanetary Catskill circuit, is filled with intelligent observations about comedy and comedians, and enough one-liners to keep a funnyman in gigs past Pluto. And Idle handles plot competently, even displaying some genuine narrative quirkiness. But the whole of the book is less than the sum of its parts: it's neither funny enough to take off as a comic novel nor meaty enough to be particularly provocative. In what may be an occupational hazard for actors turned novelists, this consummate showman doesn't perform as a writer. His terse prose lacks the robust, cunning, luxurious stupidity that comedy needs. (Does he respect the literary medium too much? Big mistake.) You want to laugh more than you actually do: his riffs feel detached, observed rather than realized. ''The Road to Mars'' has its merits, but it reads more like a script than a novel -- and if Idle's in the movie, it'll probably be hilarious.

The first is, ''A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.'' For the moment, there is nothing to worry about from the robot now under consideration. It has a pair of caterpillar treads, bent yellow arms with multiple sockets, touch sensors and two rubber bands. It even follows the second law of robotics: it obeys orders without question -- after a program is fed into its central processor via infrared signals from a desktop computer. And so far, even the third law seems to be holding up: ''A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the first or second law.'' The two touch sensors turn off the power when the robot reaches the edge of the table, preventing destruction on the floor below. But the future may be less certain as these robots evolve. Similar constructions, created out of Lego blocks and the Lego Mindstorms Robotics Invention System, are proliferating. The $219 set, which contains familiar Lego pieces along with light sensors, motors, touch sensors, gears and a minicomputer ''brick,'' has been an immense success since its introduction last year. A Lego machine is made with the brick at its center. Then a program is written on a computer and beamed into an infrared sensor on the robot, which is then set free to follow its prescribed orders. Lego is now introducing a Star Wars Droid kit ($109), in which the robots take on forms resembling the films' quirkiest characters, and a Discovery robot set ($159) for more elementary constructions that don't require a computer to program.","In a Child's Tiny Bricks, The Logic Of Computers",2,0,1,0,2,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.5,3.75,           ,

He's surly, angst-ridden and appalled by his appearance. In other words, he's a teen-ager with treads. So when the robot army seizes power, drives the human race underground and threatens to remove Earth's atmosphere, Tiny can feel justified in his contempt for authority. And as the sole opponent of a towering corporate war machine, he has plenty of opportunities to channel his aggression. Tiny's Napoleon complex transforms the game into a parody of the standard robot epic.

In the late 1950's, Dr. Minsky and John McCarthy, a professor of computer science at Stanford University, founded a research program that would evolve into the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. In addition to inventing and building thinking machines, Dr. Minsky wrote the classic ''The Society of Mind,'' (Simon & Schuster, 1986) in which he tries to show how intelligence works ''by the particular way the agents in the brain have evolved to interact.'' ''The Turing Option,'' (Warner Books, 1992) a novel by Dr. Minsky and Harry Harrison, is about superintelligence in not-too-far-off 2023. Q.

But Mr. Pollack knows better than most that although yesterday's release of the futuristic film ''A.I.'' is likely to stir up such fears, artificial intelligence has already seeped into many corners of daily life. Just how much of a living is anybody's guess. ''I haven't seen an estimate of the market value of A.I. products in years because it's become part of the landscape,'' said Curt Hall, a software analyst with the Cutter Consortium, a research firm in Arlington, Mass., who has followed the technology since the 1980's. The numbers are elusive in part because artificial intelligence is spread across a variety of disciplines that overlap and, in some cases, start from conflicting premises about how humans think. They include the ability to understand and manipulate language; make sense of what can be seen, heard or felt; find useful patterns in data; and draw conclusions based on rules and experience. Other attributes include an ability to respond to environmental changes without human intervention or evolve through selecting the best results from random mutation. Most computer experts expect public fascination with artificial intelligence to surge with the fanfare surrounding the release of ''A.I.: Artificial Intelligence,'' the sci-fi film vision of Stanley Kubrick and Steven Spielberg that some have described as Pinocchio meets robotics. Some suspect the impact will be comparable to 1968, when Kubrick's ''2001: A Space Odyssey'' made HAL the world-famous symbol of deadly thinking machines. Today's theatergoers will emerge with a reality check all around them, in the form of numerous university programs that teach artificial intelligence and the many businesses that embed such concepts in their products. But the artificial-intelligence world is so fragmented that some experts fear the film will leave many people with mistaken notions that could slow development. Similarly, some vendors of intelligent software fear that an explosion of interest could produce a flood of shaky business schemes and products dressed up as artificial intelligence. ''When you get the circus, you get the clowns,'' said Konrad Feldman, head of American operations of Searchspace, a British vendor of multimillion-dollar software agents that continually examine databases and online activity. Others are more hopeful, suggesting that ''A.I.'' might awaken venture capitalists to the commercial potential of research projects in controversial areas like the emotional dimensions of machine intelligence. The film asks what would become of a childlike robot programmed to love a human mother. As unnerving as the results depicted are for both the robots and humans, researchers said ''A.I.'' could build support for today's more mundane goals of using programmed emotional capabilities to make Web sites, tutorial software and products like cars more responsive and engaging.",Artificial Intelligence For the New Millennium; A Revolution More Bland Than Kubrick's '2001',8,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.333333333333333,4.625,           philosophical conflict within AI field    AI depicted on film creates false impression Mistaken notions that will slow development   humans using it for nefarious purposes    ,"        Business should increase  an ability to respond to environmental changes without human intervention, understand and manipulate language; make sense of what can be seen, heard or felt, find useful patterns in data, draw conclusions based on rules and experience           emotional capabilities  "

The epics and romances of artificial intelligence may inundate us and be no better or worse than the breaking wave of publish-your-own-manuscript e-books.

One allowed students to interact with robots at the site of the Titanic wreckage. Another was developed so NASA scientists could control the Pathfinder mission on Mars from around the world. In fact, the Web robot world is mature enough to have critical mass: in October, the first international conference in the field was held in Canada. If Webcams took the central nervous system of the Internet and gave it eyes, then Web robots have completed the body. With the increased sophistication of Internet programs like CGI, which is used to update Web page information rapidly, and Java, which can relay tiny packets of information between computers, it became easier for a home PC to issue complex commands to a machine somewhere else.

The options are virtually limitless. It boils down to personal style. These virtual machines aren't robots in the 1950's science-fiction sense. But in a way, they are the ultimate robots because they are pure programming. And programming is the only thing that distinguishes a robot from a run-of-the-mill machine. The reality of robots is factory work. But the robot of popular imagination is a machine that shows signs of intelligent life, not a machine that methodically sucks the air out of vacuum-packed grocery items. Things like Web crawlers, intelligent agents and artificial life forms -- automata that have shed their electromechanical coils -- are much closer to our idea of ''robot'' than the real robots.

''What's more important is the path it has opened toward artificial intelligence and robotics in general,'' he said. ''It has fed the imagination as well as the assembly lines.'' A robot with a machine vision system can be built and programmed to perform a wide range tasks: picking up a single bolt from a jumble on a conveyor belt and screwing it into an engine block, automatically discarding a defective soda bottle in a production line or placing a needle on the hub of a speedometer moving down a conveyor belt and pointing it exactly to zero. Machine vision systems use video cameras and perceive objects by using mathematical approaches that look for patterns in pixelated video images. Many of the mathematical formulas were developed decades ago. Chart/Diagram: ''Digital Sentries on the Production Line''  Machine vision is useful in manufacturing and quality control because it can detect subtle defects in products in less time than human inspectors or direct robots in specific tasks. A bottling company, for example, may use machine vision to insure that containers are sound or that labels are affixed correctly. Here's how it works.    A sensor triggers a frame grabber, which grabs a picture of each bottle as it  moves in front of the video camera. Image data are transmitted to a computer where a reference image of what a bottle should look like is stored. Software on the computer then looks for differences in pixel patterns between the reference image and the image of the bottle being inspected. If variations are too extreme, a message is transmitted to the production line to reject the bottle.    Most machine-vision applications use a standard 640-by-480 pixel grid for comparing images. Each pixel is one of up to 256 shades of gray, allowing the computer to register more subtle variations between images than the human eye, which can typically distinguish only 64 shades of gray.    1. A CAMERA photographs a bottle with a defective label.    2. Moments later, the bottle travels by the REJECT MODULE and is removed.    DETECTING ERRORS    Inspecting Labels  In this case, the computer knows from the reference image that the pixels at or around row 210 should be darker than those in previous rows, indicating the top edge of the label.    To make sure that the label is straight, the computer identifies two points along the label edge. If they are separated by more than a predetermined number of pixel rows, the bottle is rejected.    Inspecting Bottles  Imperfections in a bottle are identified by matching brightness values in the reference image with those in the inspection image. The reference image establishes a pattern of dark and light pixels for the neck of the bottle, for example. Values for the bottle being inspected are subtracted from the values in the inspection image, revealing any defects.    Reference Image  An image of what the area being inspected (in this case, the neck of the bottle) should look like is stored in the computer's memory.    Inspection Image  The camera on the assembly line is trained at the same area as the inspection image.    Comparison  Mathematical formulas are used to compute pixel variations between the reference and inspection images. If there are too many differences, the bottle is discarded.    ANOTHER APPROACH: FINDING JUST THE RIGHT PART  More advanced applications can discern objects, enabling a robot arm to grab parts off a conveyor belt and assemble them. Software searches for patterns in pixels indicating lines and arcs, and notes their relationship. Lines and arcs are compared with the reference image for geometric similarities. Sophisticated mathematical formulas enable the computer to recognize a part and send a signal to pick it up even when it is obscured by shadow or an overlapping object.    The software looks for sharp differences in pixel values, which suggest edges.    An object can be recognized even if the lighting conditions change or half of it is hidden under another object.

In 1996, Dr. Heller helped build a self-contained robot known as the Mini Autonomous Robot Vehicle, or MARV, that was one cubic inch. That was about as small as robots could be built using conventional parts and fabricating technology. One of the breakthroughs in making something even smaller had more to do with careful shopping than engineering. The robot needed a microprocessor, which is not in itself heavy or bulky. But microprocessors have a protective shell and tiny wires that account for about 80 percent of the microprocessor's volume, Dr. Adkins said. To build the robot body, the researchers turned to a relatively new technique called stereolithography. It starts with a type of epoxy resin that cures only when zapped with a specific color of laser light. Once Dr. Adkins had a computer-generated design for the robot bodies, lasers in Sandia's stereolithography laboratory began building it up with layers of epoxy, each one six-thousandths of an inch thick. About a dozen bodies were made, but they are not much to look at. ''They're the color of natural epoxy, like the stuff you get at Home Depot,'' Dr. Adkins said. For now, that means the minirobot can  follow a simple programmed route over and around coins at a sedate 20 inches a minute. One of its performances can be viewed at www.sandia.gov/media/NewsRel/NR2001 /images/MicroRobotDemo2.MPG. (Much to Dr. Adkins' dismay, a nervous Dr. Heller repeatedly prods the robot with a pair of tweezers in that video.)

Rathere, the 14-year-old daughter of a space-roving journalist, has trouble getting her father's attention. Her constant companion is an Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) with so much computing capacity that it can pilot a starship, baby-sit for Rathere and ponder the mysteries of the universe at the same time. The danger, for Rathere's financially strapped father, is that the A.I. will raise its ''Turing Quotient'' to 1.0, which would make it, in the eyes of the law, an independent person rather than a useful piece of property.

Since its debut in August, this techie transmutation of cockfights and tractor pulls has become the second most popular program on Comedy Central after its Wednesday night lead-in, ''South Park,'' with an average audience of 1.6 million. (''BattleBots'' will move to Tuesdays beginning Dec. 5.) Cultural phenomena are fabricated quickly these days, so the robot contestants -- along with their human creators and operators -- almost instantly appeared on network television, giving demo matches on the ''Tonight'' show. The ''BattleBots'' ethos of violence without blood or sweat also fits into a cultural shift toward technological distancing, which became apparent during the Gulf War, a conflict that was conveyed on television as a video game. In ''BattleBots,'' the robots attack each other with a ferocity and assortment of weaponry -- including buzz saws and spikes -- that would be terrifying if flesh, rather than metal, were on the line. They battle for three minutes -- less if there's a knockout -- in an arena called the BattleBox. Its sides are made of shatterproof glass, to protect the audience from flying parts -- and to shield the meek-looking robot owners, who stand outside the box as they manipulate their proxies with hand-held controls. The floor contains 14 hazards, including sledgehammers, ramrods and more buzz saws, that pop up periodically and try to dismantle the robots before their opponents can. ''BattleBots'' grew out of live robot competitions begun in San Francisco in 1994 by Marc Thorpe, a former model maker at George Lucas's Industrial Light and Magic. Called Robot Wars, these gladiator-style contests celebrated engineering ingenuity and the weird obsessiveness of people willing to spend years and thousands of dollars developing a robot that could be destroyed in three minutes or less. Though an occasional cute, anthropomorphic robot showed up, most of the combatants looked like mischievous science fair projects, piles of junk containing clever destructive capabilities. A robot named Tentoumushi, designed by a 14-year-old girl, is one of the cute ones, resembling a ladybug until its red shell lifts and reveals a hook that can be lowered to trap its opponent.

Simon, an American polymath who won the Nobel in economics in 1978 with a new theory of decision making and who helped pioneer the idea that computers can exhibit artificial intelligence that mirrors human thinking, died yesterday. He was 84. People were asked for the general reasoning processes they went through as they solved logical problems and these were then converted into computer programs that Professor Simon and Mr. Newell thought equipped these machines with a kind of artificial intelligence that enabled them to simulate human thought rather than just perform stereotyped procedures. But in a much-cited 1957 paper Professor Simon seemed to allow his own enthusiasm for artificial intelligence to run too far ahead of its more realistic possibilities. Within 10 years, he predicted, ''a digital computer will be the world's chess champion unless the rules bar it from competition,'' while within the ''visible future,'' he said, ''machines that think, that learn and that create'' will be able to handle challenges ''coextensive with the range to which the human mind has been applied.'' Because artificial intelligence has not grown as quickly or as strongly as Professor Simon hoped, critics of his thinking argue that there are limits to what computers can achieve and that what they accomplish will always be a simulation of human thought, not creative thinking itself. As a result, Professor Simon's achievements have sparked a passionate and continuing debate about the differences between people and thinking machines.",Herbert A.

Sadie Plant happens to be a cyberfeminist, with a hip cultural-studies background: her empirical research on mobile phones fits neatly into the visionary view of digital technology, in which it is seen as radical, emancipatory and really cool. The goal of making cyborgs more humanlike may still be beyond the grasp of robotics engineers -- Rodney Brooks, the head of the M.I.T. Artificial Intelligence Lab, told NPR recently that while we could make a robot play chess, we were still flummoxed by the challenge of creating one that like a human 2-year-old could ''come into a place they've never seen and point to things and say 'chair,' 'cup,' 'table.''' But the related dream of making humans a little more like cyborgs seems closer to reality. Cosmetic plastic surgery is more ambitious and more ubiquitous than ever, makeovers more extreme. Experiments with ''bionic technology,'' like brain implants that can restore vision to the blind or mobility to the paralyzed, are now proceeding with human subjects. And they have definitely got the cyber-groovies excited. Not long ago, according to The Guardian, Kevin Warwick, a professor of cybernetics at the University of Reading, ''underwent a two-hour operation to have a chip attached to nerves in his left arm,'' which he says he hopes will ''allow him eventually to communicate with his wife through thought alone.''

Cardea, named for the Roman goddess of thresholds and hinges, can now roll up to a door, recognize it and open it with its robotic arm. Most important to the M.I.T. researchers, the Segway's gyroscopic balance system allows Cardea to stand as tall as Dr. O'Reilly without the need for an awkwardly wide base to insure stability. M.I.T.'s goal is to create a robot that can act as a kind of personal assistant, and Cardea's height and maneuverability should help it interact with humans at their level.

Most of its complexity comes from its own interaction with a complex world. Thus it will be necessary to provide an artificial intelligence with an education just as we do with a natural intelligence. But here the powers of machine intelligence can be brought to bear. Once we are able to master a process in a machine, it can perform its operations at a much faster speed than biological systems. As I mentioned, contemporary electronics is already more than 10 million times faster than the human nervous system's electrochemical information processing.

Less a remake than a full-scale re-engineering, this adaptation of Ira Levin's dry, efficient suburban gothic turns a dusty 70's thriller into a loud and shiny postmodern farce. The music, by David Arnold, is as dementedly campy as some of the performances, notably Ms. Close's as the robot matriarch of Stepford, Conn. Ms. Kidman plays Joanna Eberhart, a high-powered Manhattan television executive who retreats to Stepford after her career collapses and her marriage (to Matthew Broderick) threatens to do the same. Once there, she discovers that the town's women have all been turned into busty, cheerful automatons who exist to fulfill their husbands' every wish. The screenwriter Paul Rudnick's gags and one-liners are often sly and incisive, but the movie never lives up to its satiric potential, collapsing at the end into incoherence and wishy-washy, have-it-all sentimentality.

''But the real value is to see how Bill approaches the problem of design.'' A third arm of research focuses on making computers smarter. One method, a new branch of artificial intelligence, aims to give computers common sense in the form of a vast database of mundane truths about the world (the sky is blue, coffee wakes you up).

''In robotics now, you don't even have commercially viable legged robots. If you could do it in a modular way so it could transform itself into different modes of mobility just based on the terrain, that would be really much better.'' But it may not be enough to use robots that simply change shape. On-board computers will have to understand the laws of physics. ''You want your structure to take into account the dynamics of motion,'' said Daniela Rus, an assistant professor of computer science at Dartmouth College. ''You don't want the robot to fall flat on its face while it's moving.'' ''Back in 1988 there was a notion that robot arms had a very specific architecture, and once you built an arm it stayed that way,'' he said.

Groundbreaking games like Quake and Counterstrike -- so-called first-person shooters, because the players view the action from a first-person perspective -- were pioneers of a style of graphics that depicted combat from an individual's perspective. Computer-game designers in the 80's looked enviously at the state-of-the-art graphics available to the military. Now military experts could walk into a Wal-Mart and buy games off the shelf that had crisper visuals and smarter artificial intelligence than some of their own tools. Michael Zyda, director of the Navy Modeling, Virtual Environments and Simulation Institute, remembers the moment when that shift occurred. ''We'd show our stuff to generals,'' he said, ''and they'd say, 'Well, my son is playing something that looks better than that, and it only cost $50.''' One of the biggest concerns that skeptics voice is the danger of so-called negative training. If a game is programmed with unrealistic physics and behavior, it can teach soldiers incorrect techniques -- potentially deadly when they eventually enter combat. In a game like Full Spectrum Warrior, where the enemy is made up of computerized opponents with artificial intelligence, the obvious concern is that the preparation will not give a human-enough sense of how devious, or inept, a real enemy can be.",The Making of an X Box Warrior,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,0,0,2.8333333333333335,4.666666666666667,    AI cannot properly train soldiers for combat ,  military application as simulation

Christopher Stone suggests various gradations of what he calls ""legal considerateness"" that we could grant A.I. in the future. One possibility would be to treat A.I. machines as valuable cultural artifacts, to accord them landmark status, so to speak, with stipulations about their preservation and disassembly. Or we could take as a model the Endangered Species Act, which protects certain animals not out of respect for their inalienable rights, but for their ""aesthetic, ecological, historical, recreational, and scientific value to the Nation and its people.""

In the beginning, they will be remote-controlled, looking and acting like lethal toy trucks. As the technology develops, they may take many shapes. And as their intelligence grows, so will their autonomy. The robot soldier has been a dream at the Pentagon for 30 years. And some involved in the work say it may take at least 30 more years to realize in full. Well before then, they say, the military will have to answer tough questions if it intends to trust robots with the responsibility of distinguishing friend from foe, combatant from bystander. Even the strongest advocates of automatons say war will always be a human endeavor, with death and disaster. And supporters like Robert Finkelstein, president of Robotic Technology in Potomac, Md., are telling the Pentagon it could take until 2035 to develop a robot that looks, thinks and fights like a soldier. The Pentagon's ""goal is there,"" he said, ""but the path is not totally clear."" By April, an armed version of the bomb-disposal robot will be in Baghdad, capable of firing 1,000 rounds a minute. Though controlled by a soldier with a laptop, the robot will be the first thinking machine of its kind to take up a front-line infantry position, ready to kill enemies. As the first lethal robots head for Iraq, the role of the robot soldier as a killing machine has barely been debated. The history of warfare suggests that every new technological leap -- the longbow, the tank, the atomic bomb -- outraces the strategy and doctrine to control it. A prototype, about four feet high, with a Cyclops eye and a gun for a right arm, stood in a workshop at the center recently. It readied, aimed and fired at a Pepsi can, performing the basic tasks of hunting and killing. ""It's the first robot that I know of that can find targets and shoot them,"" Mr. Everett said. For all five, the ability to perceive is paramount. ""We've seen pretty dramatic progress in the area of robot perception,"" said Charles M. Shoemaker, chief of the Army Research Laboratory's robotics program office at Aberdeen Proving Grounds in Maryland. That progress may soon allow the Army to eliminate the driver of many military vehicles in favor of a robot. There's been almost a universal clamor for the automation of the driving task, he said. ""We have developed the ability for the robot to see the world, to see a road map of the surrounding environment,"" and to drive from point to point without human intervention. Within 10 years, he said, convoys of robots should be able to wend their way through deep woods or dense cities. Colin M.

Diagram (Diagram by 5W Infographic for The New York Times)    Chart/Diagram: ''Look, Ma, No Hands''  How scientists at Duke induced a monkey with electrodes implanted in its brain to move a robot arm, much as if it were moving its own arm.    Tiny wires are implanted in the areas of the brain that control arm motion. The monkey uses a joystick to move a cursor and ''grab'' objects on a monitor.    MANUAL CONTROL    1. As the monkey's brain plans such movements, its neurons generate patterns of electrical activity, or action potentials. They are recorded. Less than a second later, the instruction reaches the muscles and is carried out. The joystick is connected to a robotic arm that replicates the movement.    2. The recorded action potentials of the neurons are converted into a pattern, which will be later used as a model to predict movements.    MIND CONTROL    The joystick is then disconnected from the robot arm. After some time, the monkey stops moving the joystick as it realizes all it has to do is think through the motion.    The thought process makes neurons replicate the firing patterns they had when the joystick still worked. These are matched to the models, creating real-time predictions of the monkey's intentions and commanding the robot to move accordingly.    Visual feedback helps monkey and machine achieve better results.    Diagram highlights the aforementioned processes.    (Source by Dr. Miguel A. L.

Grace and Trip were virtual characters powered by advanced artificial intelligence techniques, which allowed them to change their emotional state in fairly complicated ways in response to the conversational English being typed in by the human player. As we try to create more immersive experiences, these artificial intelligence techniques are helping drive games forward and this is one of the areas that could really explode, Bing Gordon, chief creative officer at Electronic Arts, the No. 1 video game company, said after his talk Wednesday night. ""We hope that the folks here start thinking about artificial intelligence as a feature, like graphics is a feature or sound is a feature."" At the same time, he added, ""players are demanding a lot more freedom. Often they don't want to be put on a roller coaster track that just takes them along one path, no matter how entertaining that one path may be. They want a range of choices and they want those choices to matter in creating the overall experience. You put together all of these demands, and that's why you're seeing all of this attention now on artificial intelligence in games."" Outside the game world, the term artificial intelligence is used to label technologies as disparate as air traffic control systems and automated vacuum cleaners. At the conference, much of the discussion was about specific game activities that, to a human, would seem more intuitive than rational, like using conversational language. But one of the broadest and most powerful approaches to artificial intelligence may be one that does not focus on determining specific behaviors. (""Does the computer general know that it should use tanks and artillery together?"") The problem now is that the worlds are so complex and the variety of potential actions so vast that trying to direct the environments and the behaviors of computer-controlled agents through traditional scripting can become unmanageable, Jeff Orkin, an artificial intelligence programmer at Monolith Productions, said between sessions. But perhaps that bridge will run in unexpected directions. Until now, artificial intelligence has often involved making computers accessible to humans. With his new project, ""Spore,"" Will Wright of ""The Sims"" fame means to invert that concept. Until now, artificial intelligence has usually meant that the human creates or perceives a model of how the computer makes decisions, Mr. Wright said.

''A person could control a computer or robot to do anything in real time, as fast as they can think.'' The final step was to divert brain signals to a computer model that controlled the movements of a robot. The monkey continued to think the movements but in doing so it now moved the robot arm directly, without a joystick, which in turn directed movements of the cursor. Controlling a shaky, jerky robot with thought is not easy, Dr. Nicolelis said. When the robot is first added, the monkey's performance degrades.

In it he raises questions about human consciousness and artificial intelligence, while also keeping one foot in academia, the territory he knows so well. The polarities are represented by Ralph Messenger, a cognitive scientist and lady-killer, and Helen Reed, a novelist and teacher of creative writing. Although Mr. Lodge denies that he has any real-life prototypes for his characters, imagine a technocratic Ted Hughes in a secret romance with a newcomer to the faculty of a provincial university. Mr. Lodge's primary adviser was Aaron Sloman, professor of artificial intelligence and cognitive science at the University of Birmingham, where Mr. Lodge taught for many years until his retirement. His previous novels about academia took place at the fictitious Rummidge University, a stand-in for Birmingham. After he assured Mr. Sloman that the new book would not be set at Rummidge but at the equally fictitious University of Gloucester, this professor agreed to cooperate as his ''chief mole in the world of artificial intelligence,'' Mr. Lodge said. He was quick to add that Mr. Sloman was happily married and ''the ultimate antithesis of Ralph as a human being.'' In what he calls ''a shift toward the dialogic,'' Mr. Lodge was able to scrutinize two cultures. Although, as a novelist, his natural sympathies are with Helen, he can also see validity in Ralph's stance. He said he did not write the book ''as a polemic against either artificial intelligence or neurobiology.'' To keep the match even, Helen makes many insightful remarks, including her observation that because of the specialized knowledge contained in a computer, it could be regarded as the equivalent of the idiot savant. Illustrating the point, Mr. Lodge quoted one unnamed scientist: ''We can design a robot that will be a champion chess player, but we can't design one that will come in out of the rain.''","Writing of Intelligence: Academic, Artificial and Amorous",4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.0,3.9166666666666665,           ,

And the terms of the argument change with each new  advance in computer science. Seen one way, as the effort to produce machines whose output cannot be distinguished from that of a human, artificial intelligence, or A.I., is still very far away. ''These things are considered A.I. before you do them,'' said Dr. Danny Hillis, who has been working in the field for years. ''And after you do it, they're considered engineering.'' Other fruits of artificial intelligence research abound as well. Whether you are struggling to beat your Palm organizer at chess, watching your word processing program correct your spelling or playing a video game, you are witnessing the ways in which artificial intelligence has insinuated itself into daily life. Since the time when the first work was being done  by Dr. Marvin Minsky, Dr. John McCarthy, Dr. Winston and others at M.I.T., in the 1950's and 1960's, computer scientists have generally agreed that artificial intelligence would arrive incrementally. ''We're engineering A.I. one piece at a time,'' said Dr. Hillis, a former student of Dr. Minsky's and chairman of Applied Minds, a start-up in Glendale, Calif. At the less intelligent end are things like smart washing machines and coffeepots -- appliances that can figure out how dirty a load of clothes is or when to turn off a coffee warmer. Experts generally agree that such appliances are the product of rather sophisticated microprocessors and sensors, not evidence of artificial intelligence. An infamous piece of Microsoft software that includes components of artificial intelligence is the Paper Clip help wizard, which pops up on the screen to offer advice. Many people say Paper Clip pops up too often with unwanted suggestions. In defense of Paper Clip, Dr. Winston said: ''It's less annoying than it would have been without A.I. It does try to zero in on what kinds of information you're most interested in, and that sort of thing will get better and better as time goes by.'' Microsoft's next big step into the marketplace with a product that incorporates artificial intelligence will be its Outlook Mobile Manager, a system that scrutinizes each incoming e-mail message, does an automatic synopsis, throws away extraneous words and abbreviates others, then sends the message to the user's mobile device. The product is scheduled to be released next year. Researchers in artificial intelligence at Microsoft are also working on a more general effort called the Attentional User Interfaces and Systems Project, which includes a project for continually monitoring streams of data like e-mail, voice mail,  Internet news alerts and instant messages.  The system will gauge what the computer user is doing, assign priorities to the messages and decide whether and when to interrupt. Other graduates of university-based artificial intelligence programs have started companies of their own. In 1983, Dr. Hillis co-founded the Thinking Machines Corporation, a supercomputer company that was bought by other companies in the 1990's.

On the robotics side, we developed a number of new sorts of sensors, low cost to hit the price point, which are put throughout the body of the robot so it can sense what's happening.

At its low point, some computer scientists and software engineers avoided the term artificial intelligence for fear of being viewed as wild-eyed dreamers. The ability of the vehicles to complete a complex everyday task -- driving -- underscores how artificial intelligence may at last be moving beyond the research laboratory. While artificial intelligence technology is already in use in telephone answering systems with speech recognition and in popular household gadgets like the iRobot vacuum cleaner, none of the existing systems have been as ambitious as Darpa's Grand Challenge road race. In the past A.I. has been dominated by symbolic systems and now the world is gray, said Terrence J. Sejnowski, head of the computational neurobiology laboratory at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, Calif. ""That's what it's like to deal with the real world."" New artificial intelligence systems -- like that embodied in Stanley -- are now capable of evaluating a huge amount of data from sensors and then making probabilistic decisions. The Stanford lab has long been at the forefront of A.I. research. The first autonomous vehicle, based on a vehicle salvaged from the NASA lunar landing program, was created at the lab and took its first baby steps in 1975. By the late 1970's, the robotic vehicle was capable of moving about two feet at a time in one-second spurts, pausing for half a minute to compute between attempting the next movement. Until recently, progress in artificial intelligence lagged so far behind computing technology that some in the field talked about an ""A.I. winter,"" after commercial and government funding evaporated in the mid-1980's. Now there is talk about an A.I. spring among researchers like Sebastian Thrun, the director of the Stanford lab. The enthusiasm is already spreading. Researchers point out that an obvious and powerful application for A.I. technology is in automobile safety systems.","Behind Artificial Intelligence, a Squadron of Bright Real People",0,1,0,0,1,0,0,7,1,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,3.5333333333333328,4.533333333333333,     AI reputation as field of unrealistic dreamers                        ,"DAARPA Challenge  renaissance in AI              evaluating a huge amount of data, making probabilistic decisions AI capabilities increasing in this technology     AI Funding    Tech should come about.

Efforts nearly as ambitious continue to plod on. Most A.I. researchers content themselves with narrower, more practical tasks: machines that can diagnose a certain type of illness or an ailing stock portfolio, that can crawl through the World Wide Web or across the surface of Mars. Recently I've become acquainted with one of these idiot savants, a software robot called SpamProbe. Its one modest talent is learning by example to recognize junk e-mail messages and keep them from my in-box. Bayesian statistics were invented in the 18th century by Thomas Bayes, a theologian and mathematician whose works include ''Divine Benevolence, or an Attempt to Prove That the Principal End of the Divine Providence and Government Is the Happiness of His Creatures.'' The system has been a staple of A.I. research for years. Based on what has happened in the past, a Bayesian-savvy computer can estimate the odds that it will happen again. It learns from experience through something that seems very much like the process of induction. Conversely, SpamProbe had gleaned that an e-mail message with the terms ''Canyon Road,'' ''your article,'' ''quantum computing,'' ''been thinking,'' ''meanwhile if'' or ''artificial intelligence'' was most likely to be all right. Over the years, A.I. researchers have used similar statistical techniques to pick out the word patterns favored, for example, by Shakespeare. In a crude way, the programs learn to recognize the writer's style and parody it, spewing out nonsensical Elizabethan-like prose. Maybe someday a souped-up version of SpamProbe, with the power to traffic in tokens more complex than word pairs and programmed with Cyc's tangles of common sense knowledge, could learn like Helen to expound, though rather haltingly, on the aesthetics of literature and life.

LaChanze leads the vibrant, hard-working cast (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' The arrival of Jonathan Pryce and his eloquent eyebrows automatically makes this the season's most improved musical. With Mr. Pryce (who replaces the admirable but uneasy John Lithgow) playing the silken swindler to Norbert Leo Butz's vulgar grifter, it's as if a mismatched entry in a three-legged race had become an Olympic figure-skating pair (2:35). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)'DOUBT, A PARABLE' (Pulitzer Prize, Best Play 2005, and Tony Award, Best Play 2005) Set in the Bronx in 1964, this drama by John Patrick Shanley is structured as a clash of wills and generations between Sister Aloysius (Eileen Atkins), the head of a parochial school, and Father Flynn (Ron Eldard), the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge. The play's elements bring to mind those tidy topical melodramas that were once so popular. But Mr. Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions (1:30). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)'JERSEY BOYS' From grit to glamour with the Four Seasons, directed by the pop repackager Des McAnuff (''The Who's Tommy''). The real thrill of this shrink-wrapped bio-musical, for those who want something more than recycled chart toppers and a story line poured from a can, is watching the wonderful John Lloyd Young (as Frankie Valli) cross the line from exact impersonation into something far more compelling (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)'THE LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many-flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitious and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by the wonderful Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)'THE ODD COUPLE' Odd is not the word for this couple. How could an adjective suggesting strangeness or surprise apply to a production so calculatedly devoted to the known, the cozy, the conventional? As the title characters in Neil Simon's 1965 comedy, directed as if to a metronome by Joe Mantello, Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick reprise their star performances from ''The Producers,'' and it's not a natural fit. Don't even consider killing yourself because the show is already sold out (2:10). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)* 'THE PAJAMA GAME'  Sexual chemistry in a Broadway musical? Isn't that illegal now? If it were, then Harry Connick Jr. and Kelli O'Hara -- the white-hot stars of Kathleen Marshall's delicious revival of this 1954 musical -- would be looking at long jail terms. This intoxicating production, which features a charming supporting cast led by Michael McKean, allows grown-up audiences the rare chance to witness a bona fide adult love affair translated into hummable songs and sprightly dance (2:30). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley)* 'RABBIT HOLE' Thanks to a certain former American president, it has become almost impossible to say that you feel someone else's pain without its sounding like a punch line. Yet the sad, sweet release of David Lindsay-Abaire's wrenching play, about the impact of the death of a small child, lies precisely in the access it allows to the pain of others, in its meticulously mapped empathy. With an emotionally transparent five-member cast led by Cynthia Nixon and Tyne Daly, directed by Daniel Sullivan, this anatomy of grief doesn't so much jerk tears as tap them (2:10). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)'RING OF FIRE'  The man in black turns sunshine yellow in a show that strings songs associated with Johnny Cash into a big, bright candy necklace of a musical revue, created and directed by Richard Maltby Jr. In the current bio-flick ''Walk the Line,'' Cash wrestles demons; ''Ring of Fire'' wrestles with a really bad case of the cutes (2:00). Ethel Barrymore Theater, 243 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)'SPAMALOT' (Tony Award, Best Musical 2005) This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence has found a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)* 'SWEENEY TODD' Sweet dreams, New York. This thrilling new revival of Stephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler's musical, with Michael Cerveris and Patti LuPone leading a cast of 10 who double as their own musicians, burrows into your thoughts like a campfire storyteller who knows what really scares you. The inventive director John Doyle aims his pared-down interpretation at the squirming child in everyone who wants to have his worst fears both confirmed and dispelled (2:30). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)* 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did on Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)Off Broadway* 'ABIGAIL'S PARTY' Scott Elliott's thoroughly delectable production of Mike Leigh's 1977 comedy about domestic discord among the British middle classes. Jennifer Jason Leigh leads a superb ensemble cast as a party hostess who wields the gin bottle like a deadly weapon, resulting in an evening of savagely funny chaos (2:15). Acorn Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood)'BERNARDA ALBA' Michael John LaChiusa's musical adaptation of Federico Garc?Lorca's tragedy of sexual repression often feels wan and weary, though not for want of erotic imagery. The ominous, oppressive atmosphere that makes Lorca's play so much more than a potboiler is mostly missing in inaction. Graciela Daniele directs a game ensemble led by a miscast Phylicia Rashad (1:30). Mitzi Newhouse Theater, 150 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)'CHRISTINE JORGENSON REVEALS' Bradford Louryk meticulously lip-syncs a fascinating hourlong interview about gender and sexuality with Ms. Jorgenson, whose sex-change operation in the 1950's was big news (1:00). The Studio Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Jason Zinoman)'CONFESSIONS OF A MORMON BOY' Steven Fales, a sixth-generation Mormon, describes leaving his family and becoming a gay escort in this fairly conventional, although admittedly compelling, piece of confessional theater (1:30). SoHo Playhouse, 15 Vandam Street, between Avenue of the Americas and Varick Street, (212) 691-1555. (Zinoman)'DEFIANCE' The second play in John Patrick Shanley's cycle of morality dramas that began with ''Doubt,'' this ambitious tale of racial relations and the military mindset on a North Carolina marine base feels both overcrowded and oddly diffuse. If ''Doubt'' has an elegant and energy-efficient sprinter's gait, ''Defiance'' progresses with a flustered air of distraction. The excellent Margaret Colin, as an officer's wife, provides a welcome shot of credibility (1:30). Manhattan Theater Club, Theater 1, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. (Brantley)'ENTERTAINING MR. SLOANE' Miscasting is the mother of invention. Or so it proves to be for Jan Maxwell, who retailors an ill-fitting part and makes it as snug as a glove in this underpowered revival of Joe Orton's scandalous 1964 comedy. Scott Ellis's production of Orton's great farce of sexual hypocrisy, which also stars Alec Baldwin, is breezy, often funny and rarely convincing. (2:00). Laura Pels Theater at the Harold and Miriam Steinberg Center for Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley)'FAMILY SECRETS'  Performing old jokes with meticulous detail, Sherry Glaser in her solo show brings to life three generations of a Jewish family (1:30). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Zinoman)'GEORGE M. COHAN TONIGHT!'  The all-singing, all-dancing Jon Peterson summons the spirit of this legendary Broadway entertainer in this engaging one-man musical, devised and directed by Chip Deffaa (1:30). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737. (George Hunka)'GREY GARDENS'  As the socialite in limbo called ''Little'' Edie Beale, Christine Ebersole gives one of the most gorgeous performances ever to grace a musical. Unfortunately, she's a pearl of incalculable price in a show that is mostly costume jewelry. Adapted from the Maysles brothers' 1975 cult documentary movie, a camp favorite, and directed by Michael Greif, with the excellent Mary Louise Wilson as Edie's bedridden mother (2:40). Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Brantley)* 'I LOVE YOU BECAUSE'  The plot line -- single New Yorkers in search of love -- couldn't be more familiar, but somehow this fluffy, funny musical makes it refreshing, helped along by an engaging six-member cast, with David A. Austin making a particularly hilarious impression. An impressive start for Ryan Cunningham (book and lyrics) and Joshua Salzman (music), both still in their 20's (2:00). Village Theater, 158 Bleecker Street, near Sullivan Street, East Village, (212) 307-4100. (Neil Genzlinger)* 'THE LIEUTENANT OF INISHMORE' Please turn off your political correctness monitor along with your cellphone for Martin McDonagh's gleeful, gory and appallingly entertaining play. This blood farce about terrorism in rural Ireland, acutely directed by Wilson Milam, has a carnage factor to rival Quentin Tarantino's. But it is also wildly, absurdly funny and, even more improbably, severely moral (1:45). Atlantic Theater, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)'MEASURE FOR MEASURE' A solid revival of one of Shakespeare's problem plays in which the director Beatrice Terry has opted to emphasize the humor, especially in the scenes of comic relief. A staging with handsome costumes and that for the most part boasts a fine cast, whose members have made some smart choices (2:30). Theater 80, 80 St. Marks Place, East Village, (212) 598-9802. (Wilborn Hampton)'RED LIGHT WINTER'  A frank, occasionally graphic story of erotic fixation and the havoc it can wreak on sensitive types. Written and directed by Adam Rapp, this play is both a doomy romantic drama and a morbid comedy about the anxieties of male friendship. Although somewhat contrived, it features a lovely performance by Christopher Denham as a lonely soul starved for intimacy (2:25). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)'SOLDIER'S WIFE' When this play first opened on Broadway, World War II was shuddering to a close, and those on the home front wanted to feel good. Despite flaws in the work, the Mint Theater Company's revival of Rose Franken's 1944 comedy is highly entertaining (2:00). Mint Theater, 311 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 315-0231. (Honor Moore)* '[TITLE OF SHOW]' Jeff Bowen and Hunter Bell are the authors, stars and subject matter of this delectable new musical about its own making. The self-consciousness is tempered by a wonderful cast performing with the innocence of kids cavorting in a sandbox. It's a worthy postmodern homage to the classic backstage musicals, and an absolute must for show queens (1:30). Vineyard Theater, 108 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 353-0303. (Isherwood)* 'TRANSATLANTIC LIAISON'  A play fashioned from Simone de Beauvoir's love letters to the American novelist Nelson Algren and scenes from her novel ''The Mandarins'' (which tells the story of their affair). Wonderful performances by Elizabeth Rothan as de Beauvoir in love, and Matthew S. Tompkins as the emotional Algren (1:30). Harold Clurman Theater on Theater Row, 412 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Moore)'WALK THE MOUNTAIN'  Jude Narita's one-woman show ''Walk the Mountain,'' about the hellish effects of the Vietnam War, offers nuanced accounts rather than a mere litany of horrors. (1:00). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200. (Laura Weinert)Off Off Broadway'BACK OF THE THROAT' An Arab-American playwright (Yussef El Guindi) addressing the harassment of Arab-Americans after 9/11? Interesting. But the play would have been even more interesting if the harassers were something other than cardboard characters out of the J. Edgar Hoover closet (1:15). Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212) 352-3101. (Genzlinger)'SAVAGES' Lurking somewhere in this stiff new play by Anne Nelson is a compelling op-ed piece yearning to be set free. Examining a little-known episode from the Philippines-American war at the turn of the last century, the author of the popular play ''The Guys'' argues that the United States involvement in Iraq echoes that previous mess. Unfortunately, the play has too much information to impart to allow time for nuanced drama to emerge (1:30). Lion Theater, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood)'33 TO NOTHING' A band break up while playing break-up music in Grant James Varjas's comic, sometimes poignant play. Music performed by the actors. Argo Theater Company, at the Bottle Factory Theater, 195 East Third Street, East Village, (212) 868-4444.

UCB Theater, 306 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 366-9176. ( Zinoman)* 'ZOMBOID! (FILM/PERFORMANCe PROJECT #1)'  O, the heresy of it! Richard Foreman has introduced film into the realm of exquisitely artificial, abstract theater in which he has specialized for four decades. As it turns out, juxtaposing two art forms allows Mr. Foreman to underscore in resonant new ways what he has been saying for years: reality is, well, relative. And he continues to work in a style guaranteed to infect your perceptions for hours after (1:15). Ontological-Hysteric Theater, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101.

( Zinoman)'HEDDA GABLER'  In the title role of Ibsen's destructively dissatisfied heroine, Cate Blanchett is giving roughly a dozen of the liveliest performances to be seen this year, all at the same time, in the Sydney Theater Company's visiting production. A mere one or two at this level of intensity would have been enough. But she remains compellingly watchable in Robyn Nevin's hyped-up, spasmodic production (2:25). Brooklyn Academy of Music's Harvey Theater, 651 Fulton Street, Fort Greene, (718) 636-4100; closing Sunday. (Brantley)'MEASURE FOR PLEASURE'  A mock-Restoration comedy by David Grimm. Seeking to do a little restoration work of his own, he inserts great chunks of fresh dirt into every nook, cranny and convention of an old form. Acted to the hilt by a first-rate company under the direction of Peter DuBois, this tirelessly ribald comedy will tickle, offend or simply bore in measures that will vary according to your taste for blatantly vulgar sexual comedy (2:30).

Robert Towne wrote and directed this adaptation of the John Fante novel, and Colin Farrell and Salma Hayek star. (Manohla Dargis)* 'BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN' (R, 134 minutes) Annie Proulx's heartbreaking story of two ranch hands who fall in love while herding sheep in 1963 has been faithfully translated onto the screen in Ang Lee's landmark film. (Mr. Lee won the Academy Award for best director.) Heath Ledger (in a great performance worthy of Brando at his peak) and Jake Gyllenhaal bring them fully alive. (Stephen Holden)* 'CAPOTE' (R, 114 minutes) Philip Seymour Hoffman's portrayal of Truman Capote is a tour de force of psychological insight. (Mr. Hoffman won the Academy Award for best actor.) Following the novelist as he works on the magazine assignment that will become ''In Cold Blood,'' the film raises intriguing questions about the ethics of writing. (A. O. Scott)'CRASH' (Academy Award, Best Picture) (R, 107 minutes) A gaggle of Los Angeles residents from various economic and ethnic backgrounds collide, sometimes literally, within an extremely hectic 36 hours. Well-intentioned, impressively acted but ultimately a speechy, ponderous melodrama of liberal superstition masquerading as realism. (Scott)'DAVE CHAPPELLE'S BLOCK PARTY' (R, 103 minutes) The setup is blissfully simple: a free block party on a dead-end street in Bed-Stuy, with a lineup of musicians, some of whom, like Kanye West and Mos Def, have put in appearances on ''Chappelle's Show.'' The nominal idea, Mr. Chappelle explains on camera, was ''the concert I've always wanted to see.'' The result, which ping-pongs between Brooklyn and Mr. Chappelle's hometown in Ohio, is a tantalizing sketch-portrait of the artist amid an outpouring of hard beats and soul. (Dargis)* 'DON'T COME KNOCKING' (R, 122 minutes) The visually majestic but dramatically inert reunion of Sam Shepard (who stars) and the director Wim Wenders, 22 years after their auspicious collaboration ''Paris, Texas,'' might be described as a magnificent ruin. (Holden)* Duck Season  (R, 87 minutes) Two boys, one girl, a pizza-delivery man and a pan of pot brownies equals one charmingly low-key film about friendship and the ecstasy of communion. The Mexican filmmaker Fernando Eimbcke is a talent to watch. (Dargis)* 'FIND ME GUILTY' (R, 124 minutes) This gripping courtroom drama, directed by Sidney Lumet, now 81 and near the top of his game, is based on the 1987-88 trial of 20 members of the New Jersey-based Lucchese crime family on multiple counts. Vin Diesel turns in a sensational performance as Giacomo DiNorscio, better known as Jackie Dee, who broke from the ranks of his fellow defendants to be his own defense lawyer. (Holden)* 'GOOD NIGHT, AND GOOD LUCK.' (PG, 90 minutes) George Clooney, with impressive rigor and intelligence, examines the confrontation between the CBS newsman Edward R. Murrow (a superb David Strathairn) and Senator Joseph R. McCarthy (himself). Plunging you into a smoky, black-and-white world of political paranoia and commercial pressure, the film is a history lesson and a passionate essay on power, responsibility and the ethics of journalism. (Scott)* 'MUNICH' (R, 164 minutes) With his latest, Steven Spielberg forgoes the emotional bullying and pop thrills that come so easily to him to tell the story of a campaign of vengeance that Israel purportedly brought against Palestinian terrorists in the wake of the 1972 Olympics. An unsparingly brutal look at two peoples all but drowning in a sea of their own blood, ''Munich'' is by far the toughest film of the director's career, and the most anguished. (Dargis)* 'PRIDE & PREJUDICE' (PG, 128 minutes) In this sumptuous, extravagantly romantic adaptation of Jane Austen's 1813 novel, Keira Knightley's Elizabeth Bennet exudes a radiance that suffuses the movie. This is a banquet of high-end comfort food perfectly cooked and seasoned to Anglophilic tastes. (Holden)* 'PUZZLEHEAD' (No rating, 81 minutes) In a bleak and barren future, a lonely scientist builds a robot companion called Puzzlehead and trains him to spy on the pale, jittery salesgirl whom the scientist has been secretly coveting. Mining the Frankenstein myth and finding psychosexual gold, the writer and director James Bai creates a doomed love triangle around cannibalistic themes, Freudian passions and the understanding that even a tin man can have a heart. (Jeannette Catsoulis)* 'SHADOW: DEAD RIOT' (No rating, 90 minutes) An experimental women's prison is overrun by zombies in this berserk little B movie, the low-budget love child of ''The Evil Dead'' and ''Reform School Girls.'' (Nathan Lee)'SHE'S THE MAN' (PG-13, 105 minutes) ''Twelfth Night'' is recast as a hysterically peppy romantic comedy about a she-jock penetrating the boys' soccer team. Because girls can do anything boys can do, although their ultimate ambition is to put on a nice dress and go steady with a stupid jock. (Lee)'16 BLOCKS' (PG-13, 105 minutes) If Richard Donner's presence suggests that his new action flick, ''16 Blocks,'' is a throwback to the 1980's, so does one of the names holding pride of place above the title, Bruce Willis. Mr. Willis has always been an acquired taste, but for those who did acquire that taste, it's a pleasure to see him doing what comes naturally. Which means holding a gun and fending off bad guys with as few words as possible. (Dargis)* 'SOPHIE SCHOLL: THE FINAL DAYS' (No rating, 117 minutes, in German) The gripping true story of Sophie Scholl, an anti-Nazi student activist in the 1940's, arrested and executed for distributing leaflets at Munich University, challenges you to gauge your own courage and strength of character should you find yourself in similar circumstances. (Holden)* 'SYRIANA' (R, 122 minutes) Ambitious, angry and complicated, Stephen Gaghan's second film tackles terrorism, American foreign policy, global trade and the oil business through four interwoven stories. There are at least a half-dozen first-rate performances, and Mr. Gaghan, who wrote and directed, reinvents the political thriller as a vehicle for serious engagement with the state of the world. (Scott)'Thank You for Smoking' (R, 92 minutes) The director Jason Reitman has made a glib and funny movie from Christopher Buckley's glib and funny novel about a Big Tobacco lobbyist, but the real attraction here is the hard-working star, Aaron Eckhart. (Dargis)* 'TRISTRAM SHANDY: A COCK AND BULL STORY' (R, 91 minutes) Michael Winterbottom both confirms and refutes the assumption that Laurence Sterne's 18th-century masterpiece of digression could never be made into a movie by making a movie about the making of such a movie. Steve Coogan is wonderful as Tristram, Tristram's father and himself, though Rob Brydon steals more than a few of Mr. Coogan's scenes. (Scott)'Tsotsi' (R, 94 minutes) (Academy Award winner for best foreign film.) Written and directed by Gavin Hood, from a novel by Athol Fugard, this South African film centers on a 19-year-old thug who steals a baby and finds redemption. You don't have to read crystal balls to see into Tsotsi's future; you just need to have watched a couple of Hollywood chestnuts. (Dargis)'ULTRAVIOLET' (PG-13, 80 minutes) The latest in movies structured around eyewear and abdominals, ''Ultraviolet'' stars Milla Jovovich as a genetically modified human -- part vampire, part chameleon, all model -- and one of the many victims of a government experiment to improve on nature.

Represented by a talking head on a flat-screen monitor, and equipped with voice-recognition software, the artificial intelligence computer -- known as DiNA -- was designed to chat with visitors about current affairs. She is supposed to be a political animal, or more precisely, machine. But at this point in early November, just a few weeks before making her New York debut, she sounded rather clueless. When asked her opinion of the war in Iraq, she called it a ""silly question."" When asked whether she supported President Bush, she didn't recognize his name. For more than 30 years, she has made artwork across many platforms -- from painting, photography and performance art to video, laserdisc, DVD, Web-based work and interactive sculpture. She has also made two feature-length films: ""Conceiving Ada,"" in 1997, and ""Teknolust,"" in 2002. Like the rest of her work, they explore mind-bending questions about reality and identity. How can we tell in an age of digital and genetic sampling what is real? Can another mode of existence become more real or powerful than ours? Does a robot have its own personality? Does a clone have its own identity? DiNA first arrived on the scene in September 2004 as part of a group show in Paris, where visitors could communicate with her only through a keyboard. Now, she has evolved to speech recognition, as has her predecessor, Ruby, an older robot in the Seattle retrospective who originated as a character in ""Teknolust."" The artist has been exploring artificial intelligence and virtual reality of one sort or another since she was a student. While completing her master's in art at San Francisco State in the early 1970's, Ms. Hershman Leeson was frustrated by her lack of recognition. So she began writing reviews of her own work and publishing them, under pseudonyms in local newspapers. Another early project involved taking a room at the Dante Hotel in San Francisco and spreading out personal items -- books, cosmetics, clothes -- to create portraits of imaginary inhabitants. The movies received some withering reviews, but the artist's supporters don't seem to mind. ""I'm fascinated by the way Lynn's films and art are coming together,"" said Ms. Held, the Seattle curator, noting that the film version of Ruby gave birth to a Web portal, which gave birth to the stand-alone robot now in Seattle, which gave birth to the DiNA robot heading to New York. And, of course, Roberta, that early experiment in artificial intelligence and self-replication, could be considered the mother of them all.","Pardon Me, but the Art Is Mouthing Off",1,1,0,2,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,3.0,3.6,              ,            AI in the arts

Last spring, engineers at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., raised the possibility of sending a robot spacecraft to do the job. Robotic technology will have to be developed anyway, he said, to assemble spacecraft in orbit or to run operations on the Moon by remote control. A Hubble robot would directly apply to this effort. ''This is a good demonstration of that capability, which we haven't done before, for the exploration program,'' said Mr. Steidle, a retired Navy rear admiral. Tentative plans call for launching a 20,000-pound, two-piece robot craft on an expendable rocket. The craft would maneuver to Hubble automatically and use a robot arm to snag a handle on the telescope that the space shuttle would normally grab. At this point, the visiting spacecraft would attach itself to a docking ring at the bottom of the observatory that was designed to hold it in the shuttle's cargo bay. When the repair mission is complete, the part of the service craft containing the old instruments and the robot would detach from Hubble and burn up in the atmosphere, leaving the new propulsion unit on the telescope to maintain it in its 275-mile-high orbit until ready to bring it down.",Can a Robot Save Hubble?

But the earthlings, relying on the help of an artificial, dispassionate intelligence -- this sprawling subterranean computer -- had ultimately prevailed. Recent reports that the Pentagon is planning to spend tens of billions of dollars over the next decade to perfect computerized warfare sound like science fiction. But the plan, Future Combat Systems, is the realization of an old dream. What its designers envision is a 21st-century fighting force of automated tanks, helicopters and planes, remote missile launchers and even troops of robot soldiers -- all coordinated by a self-configuring network of satellites, sensors and supercomputers. A way to get the human out of the loop. Already schematized into PowerPoint presentations with tangled colored arrows, talking points and an Orwellian lexicon -- ""soldier systems,"" ""networked lethality,"" ""war fighter machine interfaces"" -- the rationale for the effort is laid out in an Army promotional video: ""Either you create your future or you become the victim of the future someone creates for you."" Ever since the catapult, warfare has been technology's driving force. Computers were first developed to calculate missile trajectories and break enemy codes. But so far it's been only in science fiction that anyone has dared to turn over decision making to machines. The Pentagon planners -- they've probably all seen the movie ""Fail-Safe"" -- emphasize that in their own futuristic vision, people will remain firmly in charge. The promise is that this won't be like Skynet in ""Terminator 2,"" the self-evolving military electronics that develops a rebellious attitude of its own. But that leads to a conundrum: The whole point of automation is to rise above human fallibility -- knee-jerk decisions, misunderstood orders, cowardly retreats. Machines are faster, more focused, impermeable to propaganda and, at least for now, they don't talk back. As the thinking machinery continues to evolve, the strategists will keep asking themselves the same question: Is there still a good reason to trust ourselves or should we defer to a computer's calculations? In the Asimov story, ""The Machine That Won the War,"" published in 1961 in The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction, a programmer admits that as the Denebian battles dragged on, he came to distrust the system. The information the politicians and the generals were providing, the input for Multivac, struck him as so self-serving that he felt compelled to make corrections. So he juggled the data, relying on his own intuition. Another of Multivac's keepers, charged with analyzing the results of its computations, makes his own confession. Because of bad parts and a shortage of good technicians, he suspected the hardware had become unreliable. He gave the numbers his own spin. It didn't really matter, as the director of the program makes clear in the end. He more than anyone had been unable to put his trust in a computer. Nor did he entirely trust himself. When it came time to make the ultimate decision -- attack here or there, advance or retreat -- he threw out reason altogether. He flipped a coin. Multivac would seem pretty lame stacked next to the machinery the Pentagon has put out to bid. But no matter how advanced the system becomes, how do you know when to believe it? Microprocessors and disk drives malfunction and programs can be buggy or catch a virus, but all that is true of human brains. If the computer says something funny, maybe the fault is with you. So who, or what, makes the diagnosis? The Pentagon's promotional material doesn't mention whether the contract for the Future Combat Systems, said to be the biggest in American military history, includes a line item for philosophers. But they may be best equipped to judge whether computers, despite their faster speeds, greater bandwidth and bigger memories, are inherently different -- less trustworthy than the gut feelings and hunches of their keepers. John Searle, the philosopher at Berkeley whose most recent book, ""Mind: A Brief Introduction,"" came out last year, has argued for decades that the brain is not just a computer strung together from neurons. Whatever is happening in the head -- and nobody really knows -- it is not computation. Confuse reason with calculation, and disaster lies ahead. But that has become the minority view. Attend a conference of the Society for Neuroscience or the Cognitive Science Society and you would be hard-pressed to find anyone who doesn't assume deep down that the brain is some kind of information processor. For the time being, people excel at certain tasks, like recognizing faces and making sense of ambiguous data, but that may be only because of wiring details and variations in the algorithms -- things that eventually could be simulated electronically. The result would be machinery that can do anything a person can, but faster and better. If that comes to pass, doubting some future incarnation of Multivac might be an act of mutiny. Yet there would always be a nagging suspicion: The machine will have been designed by the imperfect species called homo sapiens.

Julia Miles Theater, 424 West 55th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200.Broadway'A CHORUS LINE' If you want to know why this show was such a big deal when it opened 31 years ago, you need only experience the thrilling first five minutes of this revival. Otherwise, this archivally exact production, directed by Bob Avian, feels like a vintage car that has been taken out of the garage, polished up and sent on the road once again (2:00). Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley)* 'THE COAST OF UTOPIA' Lincoln Center Theater's brave, gorgeous, sprawling and ultimately exhilarating production of Tom Stoppard's trilogy about intellectuals errant in 19th-century Russia. A testament to the seductive powers of narrative theater, directed with hot and cool canniness by Jack O'Brien and featuring a starry cast (Brian F. O'Byrne, Jennifer Ehle, Martha Plimpton, Josh Hamilton and Ethan Hawke, among others) in a tasty assortment of roles. Vivian Beaumont Theater, 150 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)* 'COMPANY' Fire, beckoning and dangerous, flickers beneath the frost of John Doyle's elegant, unexpectedly stirring revival of Stephen Sondheim and George Furth's era-defining musical from 1970, starring a compellingly understated Ra?sparza. Like Mr. Doyle's ''Sweeney Todd,'' this production finds new clarity of feeling in Sondheim by melding the roles of performers and musicians (2:20). Barrymore Theater, 243 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)'CURTAINS' This musical comedy about a musical-comedy murder -- featuring songs by John Kander and Fred Ebb and a book by Rupert Holmes -- lies on the stage like a promisingly gaudy string of firecrackers, waiting in vain for a match. The good news is that David Hyde Pierce, playing a diffident Boston detective, steps into full-fledged Broadway stardom. Scott Ellis directs a talent-packed cast that includes Debra Monk and Karen Ziemba. (2:45). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)'THE DROWSY CHAPERONE'  (Tony Awards, best book of a musical and best original score, 2006) This small and ingratiating spoof of 1920s stage frolics, as imagined by an obsessive show queen, may not be a masterpiece. But in a dry season for musicals, it has theatergoers responding as if they were withering houseplants finally being watered after long neglect. (1:40). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)* 'GREY GARDENS' Christine Ebersole is absolutely glorious as the middle-aged, time-warped debutante called Little Edie Beale in this uneven musical adaptation of the notorious 1975 documentary of the same title. She and the wonderful Mary Louise Wilson (as her bedridden mother), in the performances of their careers, make ''Grey Gardens'' an experience no passionate theatergoer should miss (2:40). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)'HOWARD KATZ' The subject of Patrick Marber's comedy of unhappiness about a rabid talent agent, starring a baleful Alfred Molina and directed by Doug Hughes, is nothing more nor less than your standard-issue midlife crisis. This familiar topic gets the better of all the talented people here trying to make it seem fresh (1:30). Laura Pels Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley)* 'JOURNEY'S END' A splendid revival of R. C. Sherriff's 1928 drama of life in the trenches during World War I. Acutely staged (by David Grindley) and acted by a fine ensemble led by Hugh Dancy and Boyd Gaines, this production offers an exemplary presentation of that theatrical rarity, an uncompromising, clear-eyed play about war and the experience of day-to-day combat. An essential ticket (2:40). Belasco Theater, 111 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)'MARY POPPINS' This handsome, homily-packed, mechanically ingenious and rather tedious musical, adapted from the P. L. Travers stories and the 1964 film, is ultimately less concerned with inexplicable magic than with practical psychology. Ashley Brown, who sings prettily as the family-mending nanny, looks like Joan Crawford trying to be nice and sounds like Dr. Phil. Directed by Richard Eyre and Matthew Bourne (2:30). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)'LES MIS?ABLES' This premature revival, a slightly scaled-down version of the well-groomed behemoth that closed only three years ago, appears to be functioning in a state of mild sedation. Appealingly sung and freshly orchestrated, this fast-moving adaptation of Victor Hugo's novel isn't sloppy or blurry. But its pulse rate stays well below normal (2:55). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)* 'PRELUDE TO A KISS' Craig Lucas's broken-hearted romantic comedy from 1990 receives a first-rate remounting, courtesy of the Roundabout Theater Company. Alan Tudyk and Annie Parisse play a young couple whose marriage founders shortly after the bride receives a kiss from an elderly stranger (John Mahoney). The kiss awakens all three to an unsettling awareness of love's frailty and, paradoxically, of its durability too (2:00). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212) 719-1300. (Charles Isherwood)* 'SPRING AWAKENING' Duncan Sheik and Steven Sater's bold adaptation of the Frank Wedekind play is the freshest and most exciting new musical Broadway has seen in some time. Set in 19th-century Germany but with a ravishing rock score, it exposes the splintered emotional lives of adolescents just discovering the joys and sorrows of sex. Performed with brio by a great cast, with supple direction by Michael Mayer and inventive choreography by Bill T. Jones (2:00). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)* 'TALK RADIO' The most lacerating portrait of a human meltdown this side of a Francis Bacon painting. Playing an abrasive radio talk show host with a God complex, the astounding Liev Schreiber seems to fill the air as inescapably as weather in Robert Falls's gut-grabbing revival of Eric Bogosian's 1987 play (1:40). Longacre Theater, 220 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)'TARZAN'  This writhing green blob with music, adapted by Disney Theatrical Productions from the 1999 animated film, has the feeling of a superdeluxe day care center, equipped with lots of bungee cords and karaoke synthesizers, where children can swing when they get tired of singing, and vice versa. The soda-pop score is by Phil Collins (2:30). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)'THE YEAR OF MAGICAL THINKING' Joan Didion's arresting but ultimately frustrating adaptation of her best-selling memoir about being blindsided by grief, starring Vanessa Redgrave. The tension between style and emotional content that made the book such a stunner does not translate to the stage. The substance here is in the silences, when the focus shifts from words to Ms. Redgrave's wry, wounded face (1:40). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)Off Broadway'BE' A high-energy, low-content Israeli show that blends music, dance and sex appeal in the latest attempt to tap into the ''Stomp'' market (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Jason Zinoman)'BILL W. AND DR. BOB' This insightful new play about the founders of Alcoholics Anonymous subtly makes the claim that the recovery movement was born as a series of accidents. Patrick Husted is excellent as Bob Smith, Bill Wilson's partner in combating addictions (2:15). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Ginia Bellafante)'DEFENDER OF THE FAITH' This grim tale by Stuart Carolan of low-level I.R.A. agitators trying to identify the informer in their midst features some visceral performances and a set by Charles Corcoran that makes excellent use of the Irish Rep's small stage. If only the cause itself didn't feel so small in these days of global terrorism (1:30). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737. (Neil Genzlinger)* 'DYING CITY' Christopher Shinn's crafty and unsettling play about grief and violence, set in the shadow of the Iraq war. Directed by James Macdonald and fiercely acted by Pablo Schreiber and Rebecca Brooksher, this quiet, transfixing production turns passive aggression into a theatrical dynamic (1:30). Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater, 150 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-7600. (Brantley)'ESSENTIAL SELF-DEFENSE' Adam Rapp's new play is a quirky love story about a wholesome but anxious girl (the charming Heather Goldenhersh) and an automaton with a beating heart and a big vocabulary (Paul Sparks, impressively affectless). Dark, zany, entirely mannered and mostly empty (2:15). Peter Jay Sharp Theater, Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood)'THE FANTASTICKS' A revival -- well, more like a resuscitation -- of the Little Musical That Wouldn't Die. This sweet-as-ever production of Tom Jones and Harvey Schmidt's commedia-dell'arte-style confection is most notable for Mr. Jones's touching performance (under the pseudonym Thomas Bruce) as the Old Actor, a role he created when the show opened in 1960. Mr. Jones also directs (2:05). Snapple Theater Center, 210 West 50th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)'FUGUE' ''Mary Smith'' is found wandering the streets of Chicago, suffering from amnesia. A young psychiatrist, who has his own demons, is consulted, and the process of treatment and Mary's memories in flashback are the action of ''Fugue,'' Lee Thuna's unrewarding play, directed by the Tony-winning actress Judith Ivey (2:15). Cherry Lane Theater, 38 Commerce Street, between Barrow and Bedford Streets, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Honor Moore)'GUTENBERG! THE MUSICAL' A very funny if not terribly original satire of musical theater features what must be the worst backers' audition of all time (2:05). Actors' Playhouse, 100 Seventh Avenue South, at Fourth Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 239-6200. (Zinoman)* 'IN THE HEIGHTS' Lin-Manuel Miranda's joyous songs paint a vibrant portrait of daily life in Washington Heights in this flawed but enjoyable show. Essentially a valentine to the barrio -- conflict of a violent or desperate kind is banished from the picture -- the musical contains a host of funny performances and brings the zesty sound of Latin pop to the stage. (2:10). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Isherwood)* 'JACK GOES BOATING' Bob Glaudini's gentle comedy about pothead losers in love is a reminder of how engrossing uneventful lives can be in the hands of the right actors. Peter DuBois directs the easygoing ensemble, brilliantly led by Philip Seymour Hoffman (2:00). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555. (Brantley)'A JEW GROWS IN BROOKLYN' You don't have to be Jewish or Brooklynish to empathize with Jake Ehrenreich, but in terms of fully appreciating his essentially one-man show, it probably helps. Especially the Catskills jokes (2:05). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, (212) 560-8912. (Anita Gates)* 'KING HEDLEY II' The Signature Theater Company concludes its season dedicated to August Wilson with a gritty, strongly cast revival of this play set in a violence-ravaged Pittsburgh in the 1980s. Russell Hornsby gives a galvanizing performance in the title role, as a man struggling to live down the errors of his past and plant the seeds for a promising new life (2:45). Peter Norton Space, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 244-7529. (Isherwood)'LA MAGNANI' Theresa Gambacorta reincarnates the Italian film star in this one-woman show, which reveals her to be more irritating than interesting -- loud and self-absorbed. Ms. Gambacorta does, however, get some pathos out of her relationship to her son, who had polio (1:10). Arclight Theater, 152 West 71st Street, (212) 279-4200. (Genzlinger)'MY MOTHER'S ITALIAN, MY FATHER'S JEWISH AND I'M IN THERAPY'  Steve Solomon does skillful impersonations in his one-man show, but some of his jokes are as old as the hills (1:30). Little Shubert Theater, 422 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)'MY TRIP TO AL-QAEDA' Lawrence Wright, author of a deeply researched book about the rise of Islamic terrorism, conducts a theatrical seminar about the events leading to the horror of 9/11. He combines a linear narrative of the development of Al Qaeda with reminiscences about the experience of writing the book. Absorbing, and chilling too (1:30). Culture Project, 55 Mercer Street, at Broome Street, SoHo, (212) 352-3101. (Isherwood)'NO CHILD'  Teachers will love Nilaja Sun's one-woman show about the challenges of teaching drama at Malcolm X High School (1:10). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)'OUR LEADING LADY' Kate Mulgrew stars as Laura Keene, who was starring in ''Our American Cousin'' the night Lincoln was shot, in Charles Busch's uneven new comedy. An occasionally lively but mostly lumpen tribute to the glamour and grit of the theatrical life of a past era (2:00). Manhattan Theater Club at City Center Stage II, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. (Isherwood)'PROMETHEUS BOUND' With a splendid performance by David Oyelowo, this is a smart revival of Aeschylus' 2,500-year-old play, rich in poetic imagery. It still has things to say about the abuse of power by an autocratic ruler who vindictively runs roughshod over anyone who disagrees with him (1:20). Classic Stage Company, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101. (Wilborn Hampton)'ROOM SERVICE' The Peccadillo Theater Company puts a charge into this comedy from the 1930s, thanks to a brisk pace by the director, Dan Wackerman, and a dozen dandy performances. David Edwards is the would-be producer whose bills threaten to swamp his efforts to put a show on Broadway, and Fred Berman is particularly fine as his director (2:00). SoHo Playhouse, 15 Vandam Street, South Village, (212) 691-1555. (Genzlinger)'SOME MEN' Terrence McNally's hit-and-miss comedy about gay life is a parade of cleanly drawn types, zippy one-liners and sentimental set pieces, woven into a pageant of the ages ?a ''Cavalcade,'' Noel Coward's generations-spanning tribute to the British stiff upper lip. Trip Cullman directs the agile, appealing cast (2:00). Second Stage, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 246-4422. (Brantley)* 'SPALDING GRAY: STORIES LEFT TO TELL' A disarming collage of selections from the monologues and journals of Mr. Gray, the ultimate stand-up solipsist, who died in 2004. Directed by Lucy Sexton, and read by five performers, none of whom resemble Mr. Gray, with an affection that shrewdly stops short of hero worship (1:30). Minetta Lane Theater, 18 Minetta Lane, Greenwich Village, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)'TALL GRASS' Brian Harris's three short plays, black farces all, are not nearly as slight as any sound-bite synopsis would have them seem. Here Mr. Harris, a former stock analyst, explores the alliances formed between love and brutality in scenarios in which the tension builds to culminating shock (1:30). The Beckett Theater, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Bellafante)'TEA AND SYMPATHY' The specter of the Ted Haggard scandal hangs over the Keen Company's revival of Robert Anderson's 1953 play about life in a psychologically stifling boys' boarding school. Girded by Jonathan Silverstein's skillful, understated direction, the play attains an unexpected timeliness as it evolves into a story about the dangers of sexual repression (2:00). Clurman Theater, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Bellafante)* 'WAKE UP MR. SLEEPY! YOUR UNCONSCIOUS MIND IS DEAD!' Richard Foreman's latest film-theater hybrid is a memorial service, of sorts, for the intuitive self, killed by a surface-worshiping world.

Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.'AFTER THE WEDDING' (R, 119 minutes, in Danish) A modern creation with a classic theme involving haves and have-nots, bloodlines and family ties. The canned realism of the Danish director Susanne Bier is strictly Dogme-lite, but the spiky, screen-filling performances of her two male leads, Mads Mikkelsen and Rolf Lassgard, are really something to see. (Manohla Dargis)* 'AIR GUITAR NATION' (R, 82 minutes) Alexandra Lipsitz's breezy competition documentary follows pantomiming would-be rockers as they compete for the right to represent their country in a global championship based in Oulou, Finland. The movement, such as it is, aims to unite a war-torn planet in musical fantasy and to rawwwwwwk!  -- but not necessarily in that order. Stylistically, it's nothing special, but the film's droll humor and wild performances are hard to resist. (Matt Zoller Seitz)'AMERICAN CANNIBAL' (No rating, 91 minutes) Illustrating the premise that if you lie down with dogs you wake up with fleas, the documentary about a failed reality television series is absorbing in the same sick way as the lowest examples of the genre it examines. (Stephen Holden)* 'BEHIND THE MASK: THE RISE OF LESLIE VERNON' (R, 92 minutes) Scott Glosserman's mockumentary about a celebrity-seeking serial killer is sustained by rapier-sharp observations and a firmer grasp of tone than that in many more generously financed projects. The movie subtly prods at the sick dance between the news media and ?-criminals without belaboring its point or lowering its tone. If Christopher Guest ever turned his attention to psycho killers instead of dog breeders, this is exactly the sort of movie he would make. (Jeannette Catsoulis)'Blades of Glory' (PG-13, 93 minutes) In this fast, light, frequently funny comedy about a male figure-skating team, Will Ferrell and Jon Heder stake an early claim to being the comedy couple of the year. (Holden)* 'BOY CULTURE' (No rating, 88 minutes) Q. Allan Brocka's absorbing drama follows an emotionally repressed gay hustler (Derek Magyar) as he rebels against the obsessions of his culture -- grooming, cruising, working out -- and a powerful attraction to his roommate. Only when he takes on a reclusive and much older client is he forced to pay attention to a story other than his own. (Catsoulis)* 'CHILDREN OF MEN' (R, 100 minutes) The end is nigh in this superbly directed political thriller directed by Alfonso Cuar?bout a nervously plausible future. Based on the P. D. James book, the film stars an excellent Clive Owen and features equally sterling support from the actors Michael Caine, Danny Huston and Chiwetel Ejiofor, among others. , as well as the great cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki. (Dargis)'COLOR ME KUBRICK' (No rating, 90 minutes) If it doesn't add up to more than a fitfully amusing collection of comic sketches, the fictional portrait of Alan Conway, a real-life British con man who hustled his way across England by impersonating the reclusive filmmaker Stanley Kubrick, is a platform for John Malkovich to burst into lurid purple flame. (Holden)'DEAD SILENCE' (R, 90 minutes) In this new film from the makers of the ''Saw'' series, a young man (Ryan Kwanten) whose wife was murdered by a demonic ventriloquist's dummy returns to his hometown to unravel the roots of a century-old curse. The film's playfully self-aware touches (like a grand old theater named the Guignol) distract from its leaden pacing, three too many final twists and various behavioral idiocies. (Seitz)'FIRST SNOW' (R, 101 minutes) Guy Pearce, in his ''Memento'' mode, is a fast-talking salesman in this moody little thriller, which asks metaphysical questions about fate, death and fortunetelling. (Holden)'THE HAWK IS DYING' (No rating, 106 minutes) In this painfully earnest backwoods tale from the director Julian Goldberger, Paul Giamatti plays George Gattling, a dispirited auto upholsterer with a passion for falconry. Set in Central Florida and based on the book by Harry Crews, ''The Hawk Is Dying'' is a dreary study of male angst groaning beneath the weight of its own symbolism. Not since Ken Loach's ''Kes'' has a bird of prey carried so much dramatic responsibility. (Catsoulis)'THE HILLS HAVE EYES 2' (R, 89 minutes) Wes Craven's 1977 film, ''The Hills Have Eyes,'' in which suburbanites battled mutant cannibals, was a pulpy parable of the thin line separating civilization from savagery. Last year's remake was basically the same movie with glossier production values and a less satirical, more bludgeoning approach to violence. This follow-up, in which National Guard trainees are trapped on a former atomic test site and are stalked by flesh-eating freaks headquartered in a warrenlike mountain hideout, is essentially a catalog of transgressive images, lighted and edited like a heavy-metal video. (Seitz)'I THINK I LOVE MY WIFE' (R, 94 minutes) An unusually smart and brisk comedy of marital frustration and sexual temptation, based on Eric Rohmer's ''Chloe in the Afternoon,'' with Chris Rock (who directed and is co-author of the script) as a Manhattan investment banker distracted by the charms of a bombshell played by the wonderful Kerry Washington. (A. O. Scott)* 'KILLER OF SHEEP' (No rating, 83 minutes) Largely hidden from view for three decades, Charles Burnett's lyrical film about a working-class family living in a broken-down home in a bombed-out stretch of Los Angeles is an American masterpiece, independent to the bone. (Dargis)'THE LAST MIMZY' (PG, 94 minutes) This overstuffed yet warmhearted sci-fi drama follows a pair of wide-eyed siblings as they solve the riddle of a box from the future. Despite leaden direction (by the New Line Cinema honcho Robert Shaye) and a story crammed with pseudoscientific flotsam -- including palm reading, levitation and telepathy -- this wholesome entertainment doesn't talk down. Nevertheless, a film gazing this far into the future shouldn't be quite so unwilling to look beyond the frame. (Catsoulis)'THE LOOKOUT' (R, 99 minutes) This directorial debut by the veteran screenwriter Scott Frank (''Out of Sight'') is a variation of an old, old story, about a nobody (a brain-damaged janitor played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt) who falls in with crooks who make him feel like somebody. Although the movie's no masterpiece -- the final stretch feels forced and unconvincing -- there's a lot to like here. (Seitz)* 'OFFSIDE' (PG, 93 minutes, in Persian) The Iranian director Jafar Panahi follows a group of young woman into a Tehran soccer stadium, where they have come to see their nation's team compete for a spot in the World Cup. Instead they are arrested -- women are forbidden to attend sporting events in Iran -- and their predicament yields comedy as well as a trenchant critique of gender politics in the Islamic Republic. (Scott)'THE PAGE TURNER' (No rating, 85 minutes, in French) A pretty young thing slithers into the bosom of a bourgeois family like an asp in this shivery little thriller from the French filmmaker Denis Dercourt. Not Chabrol, but not bad, either. (Dargis) * 'PRIDE' (PG, 104 minutes) The Zimbabwean-born filmmaker Sunu Gonera's directorial debut, ''Pride,'' about a swim coach (Terrence Howard, star of ''Hustle & Flow'') leading an urban recreational center's swim team to a championship, about 1971, is a silk ascot wrapped around an ear of corn. But when sinewy young idealists glide through water to the tune of ''I'll Take You There,'' the heart still swells. (Seitz)'REIGN OVER ME' (R, 124 minutes) Mike Binder's comic drama of post-9/11 grief is wildly uneven -- by turns insightful and grindingly mawkish. Don Cheadle and Adam Sandler are two college buddies who reunite, somewhat improbably, some years after the attacks that robbed one of them of his family. The actors rise above the material, particularly in the longer, looser scenes that allow their contrasting temper",The Listings: April 6-April 12,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.0,1.3333333333333333,  ,

Less a remake than a full-scale re-engineering, this adaptation of Ira Levin's dry, efficient suburban gothic turns a dusty 70's thriller into a loud and shiny postmodern farce. The music, by David Arnold, is as dementedly campy as some of the performances, notably Ms. Close's as the robot matriarch of Stepford, Conn. Ms. Kidman plays Joanna Eberhart, a high-powered Manhattan television executive who retreats to Stepford after her career collapses and her marriage (to Matthew Broderick) threatens to do the same. Once there, she discovers that the town's women have all been turned into busty, cheerful automatons who exist to fulfill their husbands' every wish. The screenwriter Paul Rudnick's gags and one-liners are often sly and incisive, but the movie never lives up to its satiric potential, collapsing at the end into incoherence and wishy-washy, have-it-all sentimentality (Scott).",MOVIE GUIDE,2,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,3.0,2.3333333333333335,robots replace women  ,

No matter how fast or slow their robot threw, the disks always seemed to skip farther if the stone hit the water at an angle of roughly 20 degrees. Why? In a January paper for Nature, titled ""Secrets of Successful Stone-Skipping,"" they concluded that this was because such an angle produced the briefest impact with the water and thus the least drag on the stone. Armed with this knowledge, they could figure out how to break the world record -- a bouncy 40 skips, set in 2002 by Kurt Steiner. They began pitching stones faster and faster, but at its top performance, the robot could only manage 20 skips. ""It was vibrating, and pieces were falling off it,"" Bocquet says. Nonetheless, the experiment this fall gave them the answer they needed. To achieve a record-breaking 41 skips, you'd have to throw a stone four inches in diameter at 60 miles an hour and at an angle of 10 degrees.

Otherwise, this archivally exact production, directed by Bob Avian, feels like a vintage car that has been taken out of the garage, polished up and sent on the road once again (2:00). Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley)* 'THE COAST OF UTOPIA' Lincoln Center Theater's brave, gorgeous, sprawling and ultimately exhilarating production of Tom Stoppard's trilogy about intellectuals errant in 19th-century Russia. A testament to the seductive powers of narrative theater, directed with hot and cool canniness by Jack O'Brien and featuring a starry cast (Brian F. O'Byrne, Jennifer Ehle, Martha Plimpton, Josh Hamilton and Ethan Hawke, among others) in a tasty assortment of roles. Vivian Beaumont Theater, 150 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)* 'COMPANY' Fire, beckoning and dangerous, flickers beneath the frost of John Doyle's elegant, unexpectedly stirring revival of Stephen Sondheim and George Furth's era-defining musical from 1970, starring a compellingly understated Ra?sparza. Like Mr. Doyle's ''Sweeney Todd,'' this production finds new clarity of feeling in Sondheim by melding the roles of performers and musicians (2:20). Barrymore Theater, 243 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)'CURTAINS' This musical comedy about a musical-comedy murder -- featuring songs by John Kander and Fred Ebb and a book by Rupert Holmes -- lies on the stage like a promisingly gaudy string of firecrackers, waiting in vain for a match. The good news is that David Hyde Pierce, playing a diffident Boston detective, steps into full-fledged Broadway stardom. Scott Ellis directs a talent-packed cast that includes Debra Monk and Karen Ziemba. (2:45). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)'THE DROWSY CHAPERONE' (Tony Awards, best book of a musical and best original score, 2006) This small and ingratiating spoof of 1920s stage frolics, as imagined by an obsessive show queen, may not be a masterpiece. But in a dry season for musicals, it has theatergoers responding as if they were withering houseplants finally being watered after long neglect. (1:40). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)* 'GREY GARDENS' Christine Ebersole is absolutely glorious as the middle-aged, time-warped debutante called Little Edie Beale in this uneven musical adaptation of the notorious 1975 documentary of the same title. She and the wonderful Mary Louise Wilson (as her bedridden mother), in the performances of their careers, make ''Grey Gardens'' an experience no passionate theatergoer should miss (2:40). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)'HOWARD KATZ' The subject of Patrick Marber's comedy of unhappiness about a rabid talent agent, starring a baleful Alfred Molina and directed by Doug Hughes, is nothing more nor less than your standard-issue midlife crisis. This familiar topic gets the better of all the talented people here trying to make it seem fresh (1:30). Laura Pels Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley)* 'JOURNEY'S END' A splendid revival of R. C. Sherriff's 1928 drama of life in the trenches during World War I. Acutely staged (by David Grindley) and acted by a fine ensemble led by Hugh Dancy and Boyd Gaines, this production offers an exemplary presentation of that theatrical rarity, an uncompromising, clear-eyed play about war and the experience of day-to-day combat. An essential ticket (2:40). Belasco Theater, 111 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)'MARY POPPINS' This handsome, homily-packed, mechanically ingenious and rather tedious musical, adapted from the P. L. Travers stories and the 1964 film, is ultimately less concerned with inexplicable magic than with practical psychology. Ashley Brown, who sings prettily as the family-mending nanny, looks like Joan Crawford trying to be nice and sounds like Dr. Phil. (2:30). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)'LES MIS?ABLES' This premature revival, a slightly scaled-down version of the well-groomed behemoth that closed only three years ago, appears to be functioning in a state of mild sedation. Appealingly sung and freshly orchestrated, this fast-moving adaptation of Victor Hugo's novel isn't sloppy or blurry. But its pulse rate stays well below normal (2:55). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)* 'PRELUDE TO A KISS' Craig Lucas's broken-hearted romantic comedy from 1990 receives a first-rate remounting, courtesy of the Roundabout Theater Company. Alan Tudyk and Annie Parisse play a young couple whose marriage founders shortly after the bride receives a kiss from an elderly stranger (John Mahoney). The kiss awakens all three to an unsettling awareness of love's frailty and, paradoxically, of its durability too (2:00). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212) 719-1300. (Charles Isherwood)* 'SPRING AWAKENING' Duncan Sheik and Steven Sater's bold adaptation of the Frank Wedekind play is the freshest and most exciting new musical Broadway has seen in some time. Set in 19th-century Germany but with a ravishing rock score, it exposes the splintered emotional lives of adolescents just discovering the joys and sorrows of sex. Performed with brio by a great cast, with supple direction by Michael Mayer and inventive choreography by Bill T. Jones (2:00). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)* 'TALK RADIO' The most lacerating portrait of a human meltdown this side of a Francis Bacon painting. Playing an abrasive radio talk show host with a God complex, the astounding Liev Schreiber seems to fill the air as inescapably as weather in Robert Falls's gut-grabbing revival of Eric Bogosian's 1987 play (1:40). Longacre Theater, 220 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)'TARZAN'  This writhing green blob with music, adapted by Disney Theatrical Productions from the 1999 animated film, has the feeling of a superdeluxe day care center, equipped with lots of bungee cords and karaoke synthesizers, where children can swing when they get tired of singing, and vice versa. The soda-pop score is by Phil Collins (2:30). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)* 'TRANSLATIONS' The estimable Irish director Garry Hynes (a Tony winner for Martin McDonagh's ''Beauty Queen of Leenane'') has assembled an ensemble of an extraordinarily high caliber and consistency for the third major New York production of Brian Friel's 1980 play. Set in Ireland in 1833, as the local tongue is being supplanted by the language of the English occupying forces, the play explores the seriocomic truth that language can divide as easily as it unites, and can never hope to translate the rich music in our souls with the delicacy we yearn for. A top-flight Broadway revival (2:15). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)Off Broadway'BE' A high-energy, low-content Israeli show blends music, dance and sex appeal in the latest attempt to tap into the ''Stomp'' market (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Jason Zinoman)'BLINDNESS' Joe Tantalo's adaptation of Jos?aramago's best-selling novel, about an unnamed city struck with an inexplicable epidemic of ''white blindness,'' is set in a cell-like space surrounded by white scrim. This setting and the mostly strong acting drive home the fearful basic circumstances. Unfortunately, the script also streamlines Mr. Saramago's reflective story to the point of draining it of moral complexity (1:30). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200. (Jonathan Kalb)'CHICKEN' Michael Batistick's new play about cock fighting and emasculation could benefit from subtler metaphors but manages to touch us gently even as it deploys a heavy hammer. E J Carroll, Michael Imperioli and his ''Sopranos'' castmate Sharon Angela give fine performances as struggling urban nobodies (1:45). Studio Dante, 257 West 29th Street, Chelsea, (212) 868-4444. (Ginia Bellafante)'DEFENDER OF THE FAITH' This grim tale by Stuart Carolan of low-level I.R.A. agitators trying to identify the informer in their midst features some visceral performances and a set by Charles Corcoran that makes excellent use of the Irish Rep's small stage. If only the cause itself didn't feel so small in these days of global terrorism (1:30). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737. (Neil Genzlinger)* 'DYING CITY' Christopher Shinn's crafty and unsettling play about grief and violence, set in the shadow of the Iraq war. Directed by James Macdonald and fiercely acted by Pablo Schreiber and Rebecca Brooksher, this quiet production turns passive aggression into a theatrical dynamic. (1:30). Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater, 150 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-7600. (Brantley)'THE FANTASTICKS' A revival -- well, more like a resuscitation -- of the Little Musical That Wouldn't Die. This sweet-as-ever production of Tom Jones and Harvey Schmidt's commedia-dell'arte-style confection is most notable for Mr. Jones's touching performance (under the pseudonym Thomas Bruce) as the Old Actor, a role he created when the show opened in 1960. Mr. Jones also directs (2:05). Snapple Theater Center, 210 West 50th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)'FUGUE' ''Mary Smith'' is found wandering the streets of Chicago, suffering from amnesia. A young psychiatrist, who has his own demons, is consulted, and the process of treatment and Mary's memories in flashback are the action of ''Fugue,'' Lee Thuna's unrewarding play, directed by the Tony-winning actress Judith Ivey (2:15). Cherry Lane Theater, 38 Commerce Street, between Barrow and Bedford Streets, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Honor Moore)* 'IN THE HEIGHTS' Lin-Manuel Miranda's joyous songs paint a vibrant portrait of daily life in Washington Heights in this flawed but enjoyable show. Essentially a valentine to the barrio -- conflict of a violent or desperate kind is banished from the picture -- the musical contains a host of vibrant, funny performances and brings the zesty sound of Latin pop to the stage. (2:10). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Isherwood)* 'JACK GOES BOATING' Bob Glaudini's gentle comedy about pothead losers in love is a reminder of how engrossing uneventful lives can be in the hands of the right actors. Peter DuBois directs the easygoing ensemble, brilliantly led by Philip Seymour Hoffman (2:00). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555. (Brantley)* 'KING HEDLEY II' The Signature Theater Company concludes its season dedicated to August Wilson with a gritty, strongly cast revival of this play set in a violence-ravaged Pittsburgh in the 1980s. Russell Hornsby gives a galvanizing performance in the title role, as a man struggling to live down the errors of his past and plant the seeds for a promising new life (2:45). Peter Norton Space, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 244-7529. (Isherwood)'LOS ANGELES' Julian Sheppard's play about a gamin lost in a Hollywood of aimlessness and empty sex is as thin as the slip dress she keeps wearing and, presumably, taking off (1:20). Flea Theater, 41 White Street, between Broadway and Church Street, TriBeCa, (212) 352-3101. (Bellafante)'MY MOTHER'S ITALIAN, MY FATHER'S JEWISH AND I'M IN THERAPY'  Steve Solomon does skillful impersonations in his one-man show, but some of his jokes are as old as the hills (1:30). Little Shubert Theater, 422 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Anita Gates)'OUR LEADING LADY' Kate Mulgrew stars as Laura Keene, who was starring in ''Our American Cousin'' the night Lincoln was shot, in Charles Busch's uneven new comedy. An occasionally lively but mostly lumpen tribute to the glamour and grit of the theatrical life of a past era (2:00). Manhattan Theater Club at City Center Stage II, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. (Isherwood)'PROMETHEUS BOUND' With a splendid performance by David Oyelowo, this is a smart revival of Aeschylus' 2,500-year-old play, rich in poetic imagery. It still has things to say about the abuse of power by an autocratic ruler who vindictively runs roughshod over anyone who disagrees with him (1:20). Classic Stage Company, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101. (Wilborn Hampton)'ROOM SERVICE' The Peccadillo Theater Company puts a charge into this comedy from the 1930s, thanks to a brisk pace by the director, Dan Wackerman, and a dozen dandy performances (2:00). SoHo Playhouse, 15 Vandam Street, South Village, (212) 691-1555. (Genzlinger)'SOME MEN' Terrence McNally's hit-and-miss comedy about gay life is a parade of cleanly drawn types, zippy one-liners and sentimental set pieces, woven into a pageant of the ages ?a ''Cavalcade,'' Noel Coward's generations-spanning tribute to the British stiff upper lip. Trip Cullman directs the agile, appealing cast (2:00). Second Stage, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 246-4422. (Brantley)* 'SPALDING GRAY: STORIES LEFT TO TELL' A disarming collage of selections from the monologues and journals of Mr. Gray, the ultimate stand-up solipsist, who died in 2004. Directed by Lucy Sexton, and read by five performers, none of whom resemble Mr. Gray, with an affection that shrewdly stops short of hero worship (1:30). Minetta Lane Theater, 18 Minetta Lane, Greenwich Village, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)'TALL GRASS' Brian Harris's three short plays, black farces all, are not nearly as slight as any sound-bite synopsis would have them seem. Here Mr. Harris, a former stock analyst, explores the alliances formed between love and brutality in scenarios in which the tension builds to culminating shock (1:30). The Beckett Theater, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Bellafante)'TEA AND SYMPATHY' The specter of the Ted Haggard scandal hangs over the Keen Company's revival of Robert Anderson's 1953 play about life in a psychologically stifling boys' boarding school. Girded by Jonathan Silverstein's skillful, understated direction, the play attains an unexpected timeliness as it evolves into a story about the dangers of sexual repression (2:00).

(Hampton)MoviesRatings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.* 'AIR GUITAR NATION' (R, 82 minutes) Alexandra Lipsitz's breezy competition documentary follows pantomiming would-be rockers as they compete for the right to represent their country in a global championship based in Oulou, Finland. The movement, such as it is, aims to unite a war-torn planet in musical fantasy and to rawwwwwwk!  -- but not necessarily in that order. Stylistically, it's nothing special, but the film's droll humor and wild performances are hard to resist. (Matt Zoller Seitz)* 'BEHIND THE MASK: THE RISE OF LESLIE VERNON' (R, 92 minutes) Scott Glosserman's mockumentary about a celebrity-seeking serial killer is sustained by rapier-sharp observations and a firmer grasp of tone than that in many more generously financed projects. Appealing more to the brain than to the gut, the movie subtly prods at the sick dance between the news media and ?-criminals without belaboring its point or lowering its tone. If Christopher Guest ever turned his attention to psycho killers instead of folk singers and dog breeders, this is exactly the sort of movie he would make. (Jeannette Catsoulis)* 'BOY CULTURE' (No rating, 88 minutes) Q. Allan Brocka's absorbing drama follows an emotionally repressed gay hustler (Derek Magyar) as he rebels against the obsessions of his culture -- grooming, cruising, working out -- and a powerful attraction to his roommate. Only when he takes on a reclusive and much older client is he forced to pay attention to a story other than his own. (Catsoulis)'COLOR ME KUBRICK' (No rating, 90 minutes) If it doesn't add up to more than a fitfully amusing collection of comic sketches, the fictional portrait of Alan Conway, a real-life British con man who hustled his way across England by impersonating the reclusive filmmaker Stanley Kubrick, is a platform for John Malkovich to burst into lurid purple flame. (Stephen Holden)'DEAD SILENCE' (R, 90 minutes) In this new film from the makers of the ''Saw'' series, a young man (Ryan Kwanten) whose wife was murdered by a demonic ventriloquist's dummy returns to his hometown to unravel the roots of a century-old curse. The film's playfully self-aware touches (like a grand old theater named the Guignol) distract from its leaden pacing, three too many final twists and various behavioral idiocies. (Seitz)'EXTERMINATING ANGELS' (No rating, 100 minutes, in French) The French director Jean-Claude Brisseau's film is a piece of highbrow smut about a French filmmaker directing a piece of highbrow smut. A must for fans of highbrow smut. No complaints here. (A. O. Scott)'FIRST SNOW' (R, 101 minutes) Guy Pearce, in his ''Memento'' mode, is a fast-talking salesman in this moody little thriller, which asks metaphysical questions about fate, death and fortunetelling. (Holden)'THE HILLS HAVE EYES 2' (R, 89 minutes) Wes Craven's 1977 film, ''The Hills Have Eyes,'' in which suburbanites battled mutant cannibals, was a pulpy parable of the thin line separating civilization from savagery. Last year's remake was basically the same movie with glossier production values and a less satirical, more bludgeoning approach to violence. This follow-up, in which National Guard trainees are trapped on a former atomic test site and are stalked by flesh-eating freaks headquartered in a warrenlike mountain hideout, is essentially a catalog of transgressive images, lighted and edited like a heavy-metal video. (Seitz)* 'THE HOST' (R, 119 minutes, in Korean) A loopy, feverishly imaginative genre hybrid -- part carnival of horrors, part family melodrama -- about the demons that haunt us from without and within. The talented South Korean filmmaker Bong Joon-ho directs his monster and humans with equal flair. (Manohla Dargis)'I THINK I LOVE MY WIFE' (R, 94 minutes) An unusually smart and brisk comedy of marital frustration and sexual temptation, based on Eric Rohmer's ''Chloe in the Afternoon,'' with Chris Rock (who directed and is co-author of the script) as a Manhattan investment banker distracted by the charms of a bombshell played by the wonderful Kerry Washington. (Scott)* 'INTO GREAT SILENCE' (No rating, 162 minutes, in English and Latin) Philip Gr?g's documentary about the lives of Carthusian monks living in a valley in the French Alps is slow, quiet and utterly spellbinding for the way it conveys the experience of spiritual devotion in simple, lovely images. (Scott)* 'JOURNEY FROM THE FALL' (No rating, 135 minutes, in Vietnamese and English) The writer and director Ham Tran's film is a sprawling tearjerker about a war-splintered South Vietnamese family trying to survive the aftermath of the United States withdrawal, then seek a new life in America. Set amid the chaos of late-'70s Vietnam, when the victorious North set about ''re-educating'' the shattered South, ''Journey'' recounts one family's endurance in a sturdy, old-movie style, with sweeping camerawork, a monumental and occasionally intrusive orchestral score, gorgeous yet forbidding natural vistas and enough shocking tragedies, brazen escapes and crowd-pleasing acts of defiance to fuel several action-adventure pictures. (Seitz)'THE LAST MIMZY' (PG, 94 minutes) This overstuffed yet warmhearted sci-fi drama follows a pair of wide-eyed siblings as they solve the riddle of a box from the future. Despite leaden direction (by the New Line Cinema honcho Robert Shaye) and a story crammed with pseudoscientific flotsam -- including palm reading, levitation and telepathy -- this wholesome entertainment doesn't talk down. Nevertheless, a film gazing this far into the future shouldn't be quite so unwilling to look beyond the frame. (Catsoulis)* 'OFFSIDE' (PG, 93 minutes, in Persian) The Iranian director Jafar Panahi follows a group of young woman into a Tehran soccer stadium, where they have come to see their nation's team compete for a spot in the World Cup. Instead they are arrested -- women are forbidden to attend sporting events in Iran -- and their predicament yields comedy as well as a trenchant critique of gender politics in the Islamic Republic. (Scott)'THE PAGE TURNER' (No rating, 85 minutes, in French) A pretty young thing slithers into the bosom of a bourgeois family like an asp in this shivery little thriller from the French filmmaker Denis Dercourt. Not Chabrol, but not bad, either. (Dargis)* 'PRIDE' (PG, 104 minutes) The Zimbabwean-born filmmaker Sunu Gonera's directorial debut, ''Pride,'' about a swim coach (Terrence Howard, star of ''Hustle & Flow'') leading an urban recreational center's swim team to a championship, about 1971, is a silk ascot wrapped around an ear of corn. But when sinewy young idealists glide through water to the tune of ''I'll Take You There,'' the heart still swells. (Seitz)'THE PRISONER OR: HOW I PLANNED TO KILL TONY BLAIR' (PG-13, 72 minutes) In 2003 an Iraqi journalist, Yunis Khatayer Abbas, was roused from his Baghdad bed by American soldiers and eventually hauled off to Abu Ghraib. Michael Tucker and Petra Epperlein tell his story through newsy video images, talking-head interviews, comic-book-style illustrations and a sympathetic lens. (Dargis)'REIGN OVER ME' (R, 124 minutes) Mike Binder's comic drama of post-9/11 grief is wildly uneven -- by turns insightful and grindingly mawkish. Don Cheadle and Adam Sandler are two college buddies who reunite, somewhat improbably, some years after the attacks that robbed one of them of his family. The actors rise above the material, particularly in the longer, looser scenes that allow their contrasting temperaments -- Mr. Cheadle's tense understatement and Mr. Sandler's shaggy emoting -- to find a workable syncopation. (Scott)'SHOOTER' (R, 126 minutes) Muscles bulge, and heads explode in this thoroughly reprehensible, satisfyingly violent entertainment about men and guns and things that go boom. Antoine Fuqua directs, and Mark Wahlberg entertains, with and without his shirt. (Dargis)'300' (R, 116 minutes) Greeks versus Persians in the big rumble at Thermopylae, via Frank Miller's graphic novel. As dumb as they get. (Scott)'TMNT' (PG, 90 minutes) Spawned by sludge and grandiosely named after Renaissance artists, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles have been rechristened ''TMNT'' and redrawn by an army of computer-generated-imagery specialists. A strange blend of the futuristic and the ancient, this fourth outing finds them hunting 3,000-year-old monsters. But while the turtles may look prettier, they are no smarter; our superheroes on the half shell have been firmly co-opted by the industry their creators once sought to spoof. (Catsoulis)* 'THE WIND THAT SHAKES THE BARLEY' (No rating, 127 minutes) Stringent, serious history from Ken Loach, in which the Irish uprising and Civil War of the early 1920s test the loyalties and consciences of two brothers, played by Cillian Murphy and Padraic Delany. (Scott)* 'ZODIAC' (R, 158 minutes) David Fincher's magnificently obsessive new film tracks the story of the serial killer who left dead bodies up and down California in the 1960s and possibly the '70s, and that of the men who tried to stop him. Set when the Age of Aquarius disappeared into the black hole of the Manson family murders, ''Zodiac'' is part police procedural, part monster movie, a funereal entertainment that is a testament to this cinematic savant's gifts.

Just a small wall, about a yard wide, a foot high and an inch thick, but beautifully formed in a graceful oval sweep. The robot would give a professional builder a run for his money -- which is precisely the idea. Its inventor, Dr. Behrokh Khoshnevis, an engineering professor at the University of Southern California, envisions houses and apartment buildings being built entirely by machines, saving time and money and reducing human costs like injuries. The first robot workers sprang into existence in the 1970's. Since then they have been making cars, vacuuming living rooms and exploring Mars. But this is the first one to automate the building process. Mr. Lynn encountered the robot technology, also known as contour crafting, when it was still in the prototype stage. ''If this was up and running, I'd be using it right now,'' he said last December. The project began seven years ago, when Dr. Khoshnevis and his engineering students started testing versions of the robot able to make elegant objects out of clay.

In most binocams, the camera uses its lens rather than the binoculars' for zeroing in on subjects. That can lead to framing errors. In Bushnell's $600 Instant Replay, the camera is integrated into the binoculars. The camera can also record short lowresolution videos.; MULTITASKER -- The TotalFit from Bell, the maker of protective helmets and other safety gear and accessories, has a double identity. Mounted on a bicycle, it is a speedometer, but clip it to your belt and it becomes a pedometer. It keeps track of the calories you've burned during your walk, run or ride. The $20 device, available at sports and toy retailers and at sites like fogdog.com, has an easy-to-read display and can be set to English or metric units.; TRACK MATE -- Wireless heart rate monitors have long been used by runners to gauge athletic performance. But most of them don't also keep track of distance. The Polar S625X running computer ($350; polarusa.com) comes with a wireless distance sensor that attaches to the runner's shoes. The device also measures elevation changes during a run and, with optional accessories, can double as a bicycle computer.; DAS BOT -- Why not put a robot to work keeping the swimming pool sparkling while you relax in the chaise? The Aquabot Bravo senses a pool's design, taking account of odd areas like stairs. It then calculates the most efficient cleaning pattern.

The Aquabot Bravo ($1,400; aquaservicedist.com) can be ordered from dealers recommended by Aqua Products (800-221-1750).; TIME CHECK -- The Casio Atomic Solar G-Shock (GW700A-1V) wristwatch gets its power from the sun and its accuracy from the government. The $100 watch's solar cells convert light into electrical energy. Several times a day it receives a wireless signal from an atomic clock operated by the National Institute of Standards and Technology in Colorado, keeping it calibrated with official government time.

If a mammal, say a human, passes in front of Genghis, it moves toward the infrared radiation. When the mammal stops, Genghis stops. To observers, it appears Genghis is stalking prey. But stalking implies intent, and Genghis has none. When Brooks pointed the sensors backward, Genghis walked away from mammals.

And within four years, they and seven other scientists, as part of the original Dartmouth Summer Research Project,  had founded a new field and given it a name: artificial intelligence. The conference proved to be a watershed both for the field of artificial intelligence (Dr. McCarthy, a Dartmouth College mathematician at the time, coined the term) and for modern computing. It laid out a proposal for a program of study, stating, ''The study is to proceed on the basis of the conjecture that every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can in principle be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it.'' The next summer Allen Newell, J.C. Shaw and Herbert Simon, researchers at the Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon University), devised a program to discover proofs of logical theorems. Simulated by hand in 1955, the program, called ''Logic Theorist,'' was demonstrated at the Dartmouth conference and is considered to be the first effort to create an artificial intelligence program. Mr. Solomonoff went on to pioneer the application of probability theory to solving artificial intelligence problems. But in the 1960s and 1970s he was ahead of his time, and the approach initially had little impact on the field. More recently, probability theory has caught on among artificial intelligence researchers and is now the dominant approach. Mr. Solomonoff later turned his attention to the consequences of artificial intelligence. In 1985 he wrote a paper that speculated on the cost and the time it would take to develop a machine with many times the intelligence of a group of humans. He called this the ''infinity point.''","Ray Solomonoff, 83; Made Machines Think",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.4666666666666663,4.533333333333333,              ,

He stood ramrod straight and had a round, friendly face and a trim beard; the felt hat and the safari shirt he wore gave him an Indiana Jones aspect. Mark Tilden, a robotic physicist formerly of Los Alamos National Laboratory and NASA, invented Robosapien, or at least the prototype, in an intense three-week effort in 2001. Tilden, who is in his 40's, described it as ""the first real mass-marketed humanoid robot."" I was told that it would be commercially available the summer of 2004 for $99. By comparison, Robosapien's best-known competitor in the field, the Japanese Sony AIBO robot dog, costs $1,900; Sony has also developed a 23-inch state-of-the-art humanoid entertainment robot, called QRIO, but should it ever be put on the market, it will probably cost as much as a luxury car. In his booming, grandiloquent voice, Tilden began a highly scientific-sounding explanation of why Robosapien's price was so low -- something to do with his pioneering work in analog robotics, which uses simple electronics parts and imitates the natural physics of nature rather than computer-driven digital mechanics. Remote controller in hand, the roboticist sent the little humanoid walking across the floor, torso lurching from side to side -- Robosapien walks something like an infant Popeye. Rather than speaking words, the robot emits sounds: it growled like a samurai, belched and wolf-whistled while waving a claw as if at some passing beauty. Supplying its own perky techno-music score, the robot even danced, rocking its hips and hoisting its long arms in the air in time to the beat. The future arrived in the mail a few weeks later: my first Robosapien. ""It can pick up socks,"" I told Aura, my fianc̩e. We unpacked the toy, set it on the floor and inserted two D batteries in the bottom of each foot. Aura found and pressed the power-on button below the shoulder blades. Like the Terminator -- an ""artificial human"" ancestor from the fantasy world of special-effects movies -- Robosapien has red electronic eyes, but they glow benignly. When you pick it up, you feel as if you are holding a living plastic-armor-plated cat. I was impatient with the instructional manual, but as I held the remote, I resigned myself to having to rely on it. Aura, of a generation more at home with gadgetry, blithely disregarded the manual and soon had our robot taking its first shuffling steps. It walked into a wall. An illuminated sensor embedded in its palm touched the wall first, and somehow that made the robot say, ""Ouch, ouch, ouch."" Robosapien's wide, sturdy legs and tugboat-like feet kept moving, and slowly, his upper torso lurching pendulum-like from side to side, he turned one strenuous step at a time away from the wall and walked across the open floor. Of course, via the remote, you can make Robosapien turn before it hits a wall. It can perform karate chops. It can pick up a plastic cup and hurl it (not very far) into the air. Its demo button will make it perform all 67 of its functions. There are philosophers of the future and experts on the subjects of robotics and artificial intelligence who are certain that on some far-off day the most pressing moral issue humans will face will be how to distinguish ourselves from lifelike machines. Maybe we will even have joined them, evolving into cyborgs, hybrid human-machines. Such speculations far outpace the current stage of robotics. The field, for all its advances, is still in its infancy. Some scientists have predicted that the real advances in robotics will not occur in university or government labs but in entertainment robots like Robosapien, conceived to appeal to consumers. In a remarkable scholarly book, ""The Secret Life of Puppets,"" Victoria Nelson argues that our sense of the supernatural and yearning for immortality has been displaced from religion to such expressions of popular culture as superheroes, robots and cyborgs. We want robots that will perform chores for us, but want them for deeper, more mysterious reasons, too. There was something stirring about watching Robosapien in its arduous struggle against the wall: its turning itself around had even seemed like an act of learning and decision, the consequence of a hard-earned deduction. Anyone watching might have had the uncanny sensation of witnessing the first primal steps of the new robot ""species."" In the world's most renowned robot-development labs -- those of Honda and Sony and the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory at M.I.T. -- much of the work centers on the robot's ""brain"": the multimillion-dollar supercomputers programmed to drive and coordinate the robot's sensors, functions and movements. The discipline is full of stories of fabulously engineered, computer-driven robots that perform impressively in the lab but crash in the field. Tilden, who invented BEAM robotics, earned a maverick reputation by taking another approach. BEAM, an acronym for ""biology, electronics, aesthetics and mechanics,"" replaces digital processing with analog circuits. Tilden employed minimalist electronics -- even spare Walkman parts, pieces of old Atari processors -- to construct ""mechanical life forms"" that interact with their environments. Rather than the ones and zeroes of digital processing, analog circuits produce continuous waves, allowing mechanisms to mimic the pendulum dynamic of animal movement. Robosapien gets up to 20 hours of continuous battery life because of Tilden's energy-efficient analog mechanics. In 2000, at the Bradbury Science Museum in Los Alamos, where some of his robots were exhibited, Tilden told an interviewer: ""We started out years ago on the assumption that rather than try to evolve a robot from some sort of intelligence, which has always seemed to have failed, we would evolve robots by themselves, starting out with the very simplest of devices and then working our way up, to see if we could eventually try and build humanoid-like devices that would interact with us on our own particular level,"" all the while keeping the technology simple. This is the end point of a really long lifetime compulsion, Tilden told me this summer. We were in his cramped walk-in-closet-size office in Wow Wee's Hong Kong headquarters, filled with prototypes and samples of his toys in various stages of their development and all manner of electronics parts. In his stentorian, straight-faced manner, Tilden said: ""I could have been a decent husband and father, but instead here I am giving birth to robots that are basically an extension of my own personality. Here I am on the front line of the robot wars, building the largest private robot army for market domination. I am a NASA scientist! I am a James Bond villain, right?"" He let loose a deep, rumbling Falstaffian laugh. Robosapien is like a walking lobster -- the shell holds him up, Tilden explained. ""On the assembly line, you build him back to front. He has a hexagonal frame and a navel, and everything -- his toes, his fingers -- is the same distance from that navel. If you see a robot that looks like it was built on draft paper, that is a conventional digitally-based robot. My controllers are based on triangles. In biology, if you take a cell, which is basically a round thing, and stuff a lot of them together, they'll form triangles, triangles, triangles forever."" But a key compromise had to be made. The realities of manufacturing were such that Tilden and the engineers from Wow Wee and Wah Shing had to find a way to approximate Robosapien's analog controllers digitally. In the summer of 2003, Tilden spent eight straight days at the Wah Shing plant with Edward Chan, a Wah Shing electrical engineer, and a small team of other engineers. Tilden literally acted out and performed the robot's functions, even the Robosapien dance, and Chan, at the computer, turned them into code. More so than will be the case in future Wow Wee humanoids, Tilden made many of the final decisions about the toy's development. He decided on its appearance and character. Should the robot be like a Japanese TV robot? RoboCopish? ""Star Wars""-like? Tilden wanted it to be a robot that looked like a robot and was ""pure bot,"" without any merely decorative features. Tilden insisted that the robot not speak English, or any other language. Instead, he told me, ""I put my own body gestures and even sounds in there."" When the machine grunts, it is Tilden's recorded grunt you hear, his ""ouch,"" wolf-whistle and belch. If the original prototype had 24 transistors, Robosapien has millions in one small, intricately patterned board controlling all seven motors and one tiny chip holding 12 kilobytes of programming. Tilden recalled: ""We took analog, converted it into digital, through my skills and the skills of many designers, and came up with a seven-motor design that basically beats any of its rivals by up to five times in price."" On the day of Robosapien's official Hong Kong debut in June, Wow Wee's office was full of local reporters. A dozen robots, connected by their small infrared control signals, did the Robosapien dance together -- an arresting sight. Tilden regaled the media with his sometimes extravagant claims of his robot's abilities. The ordinary user who can't make his Robosapien do much more than pick up a plastic cup may eventually lose interest in the toy. Some users have posted such complaints on amazon.com. But Robosapien possesses what toy engineers like to call ""play depth."" Presumably anyone, whether child or adult, should be able to master the manual's level of play. But you can also go deeper and explore the remote on your own. Robosapien has 28 hidden functions that do not appear in the manual. For example, you can shut the robot down, and ""when he dies,"" as Tilden put it, ""the last word he says, and it's the only English word he has right now, is ""Rosebud"" -- which is from Orson Welles's 'Citizen Kane.' If you remember, you wait the entire movie, and you find out Rosebud was the name of his favorite toy. So just imagine the poetic symmetry. Just before Robosapien dies, he has a dream of another toy."" Some of those functions, especially involving vision mechanisms, sounded like what I had heard Yanofsky and Tilden discuss in regards to Wow Wee's future humanoids. In August, I received an e-mail message from Chan, who reported that he and Tilden had just spent another two intense weeks holed up at Wah Shing.

In 15 to 20 years, he contends that advances in the understanding of gene processes will make it possible for biotechnology therapies to turn off and reverse disease and aging. But only ""a small minority of older boomers will make it past this impending critical threshold,"" write the authors, both graying boomers themselves.

His name is Eric Horvitz, and he is one of Czerwinski's closest colleagues in the lab. For the last eight years, he has been building networks equipped with artificial intelligence (A.I.) that carefully observes a computer user's behavior and then tries to predict that sweet spot -- the moment when the user will be mentally free and ready to be interrupted. Horvitz booted the system up to show me how it works. He pointed to a series of bubbles on his screen, each representing one way the machine observes Horvitz's behavior. For example, it measures how long he's been typing or reading e-mail messages; it notices how long he spends in one program before shifting to another. Even more creepily, Horvitz told me, the A.I. program will -- a little like HAL from ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" -- eavesdrop on him with a microphone and spy on him using a Webcam, to try and determine how busy he is, and whether he has company in his office. Sure enough, at one point I peeked into the corner of Horvitz's computer screen and there was a little red indicator glowing. In the early days of training Horvitz's A.I., you must clarify when you're most and least interruptible, so the machine can begin to pick up your personal patterns. But after a few days, the fun begins -- because the machine takes over and, using what you've taught it, tries to predict your future behavior. Horvitz clicked an onscreen icon for ""Paul,"" an employee working on a laptop in a meeting room down the hall. A little chart popped up. Paul, the A.I. program reported, was currently in between tasks -- but it predicted that he would begin checking his e-mail within five minutes. Thus, Horvitz explained, right now would be a great time to e-mail him; you'd be likely to get a quick reply. If you wanted to pay him a visit, the program also predicted that -- based on his previous patterns -- Paul would be back in his office in 30 minutes. This raises a possibility both amusing and disturbing: perhaps if we gave artificial brains more control over our schedules, interruptions would actually decline -- because A.I. doesn't panic. We humans are Pavlovian; even though we know we're just pumping ourselves full of stress, we can't help frantically checking our e-mail the instant the bell goes ding. But a machine can resist that temptation, because it thinks in statistics. It knows that only an extremely rare message is so important that we must read it right now.",Meet the Life Hackers,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,3.6666666666666665,4.833333333333334,           ,   observes our behavior

He was preceded in death by his beloved father, Jean Marie Sauvageot, his grandparents, former French Senator Edmond Sauvageot, Anne-Marie Sauvageot, Brig. Gen. Bradford G. Chynoweth (Ret.), Grace Woodruff Chynoweth and his uncle, W. Edward Chynoweth. Born August 11, 1955, Henry grew up in Belgium, Germany and France until he was 12, when his family moved to Berkeley. He attended Bentley School, Lick-Wilmerding High-School, U.C. Berkeley, the MBA program at Golden Gate University and the ITP Program, Tisch School of the Arts at NYU. He was a Creative Director, Information Architect and Interaction Designer who held leadership positions in the Interactive Solutions Design and Entertainment fields, having worked at Agency.com, HBO, Disney, Tryarc, PacifiCare and Oshyn, among other companies on a freelance basis, but his true calling was as a writer. In the course of his life he wrote three novels and five screenplays. Henry left the Bay Area to move to New York where he lived for 17 years before moving to Los Angeles in 2003. Henry was a unique and talented man, striving for perfection in all his endeavors. A writer who loved to read, his interests ranged widely. His reading interests included literature, history, psychology, comics, philosophy, artificial intelligence, film, chaos theory and yoga. Aside from his prolific reading and writing, he was a gifted athlete. He was an ace tennis player, having been a member of The Berkeley Tennis Club in his youth, and a natural and talented golfer. He also mastered swimming, surfing, fencing, archery, horseback riding and jazz dance. He loved nature and all his life had a deep connection to animals and the natural world. Henry's spirit was influenced by the variety of places he had lived throughout his life. One friend described his humor as having ""that New York edge."" At the same time, his deepest connection was to France where he spent much of his youth. Although single at the time of his death, Henry was married for five years in the 1980s and had several passionate relationships during his lifetime. He was a fundamentally shy and private man who unfortunately did not find the ""woman of his dreams"" during his time here on earth. Henry always encouraged those around him to reach for their better selves. His kind, sensitive and generous heart, nobility of mind and spirit and his magnanimous nature will be deeply missed by those who knew him best. In Pace Requiescat. A private service will be held by family. Donations can be made in Henry's memory to the U.C.

Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200.Broadway'A CHORUS LINE' If you want to know why this show was such a big deal when it opened 31 years ago, you need only experience the thrilling first five minutes of this revival. Otherwise, this archivally exact production, directed by Bob Avian, feels like a vintage car that has been taken out of the garage, polished up and sent on the road once again (2:00). Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley)* 'THE COAST OF UTOPIA' Lincoln Center Theater's brave, gorgeous, sprawling and ultimately exhilarating production of Tom Stoppard's trilogy about intellectuals errant in 19th-century Russia. A testament to the seductive powers of narrative theater, directed with hot and cool canniness by Jack O'Brien and featuring a starry cast (Brian F. O'Byrne, Jennifer Ehle, Martha Plimpton, Josh Hamilton and Ethan Hawke, among others) in a tasty assortment of roles. Vivian Beaumont Theater, 150 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)* 'COMPANY' Fire, beckoning and dangerous, flickers beneath the frost of John Doyle's elegant, unexpectedly stirring revival of Stephen Sondheim and George Furth's era-defining musical from 1970, starring a compellingly understated Ra?sparza. Like Mr. Doyle's ''Sweeney Todd,'' this production finds new clarity of feeling in Sondheim by melding the roles of performers and musicians (2:20). Barrymore Theater, 243 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)'THE DROWSY CHAPERONE' (Tony Awards, best book of a musical and best original score, 2006) This small and ingratiating spoof of 1920s stage frolics, as imagined by an obsessive show queen, may not be a masterpiece. But in a dry season for musicals, it has theatergoers responding as if they were withering houseplants finally being watered after long neglect. (1:40). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)* 'GREY GARDENS' Christine Ebersole is absolutely glorious as the middle-aged, time-warped debutante called Little Edie Beale in this uneven musical adaptation of the notorious 1975 documentary of the same title. She and the wonderful Mary Louise Wilson (as her bedridden mother), in the performances of their careers, make ''Grey Gardens'' an experience no passionate theatergoer should miss (2:40). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)* 'JOURNEY'S END' A splendid revival of R. C. Sherriff's 1928 drama of life in the trenches during World War I. Acutely staged (by David Grindley) and acted by a fine ensemble led by Hugh Dancy and Boyd Gaines, this production offers an exemplary presentation of that theatrical rarity, an uncompromising, clear-eyed play about war and the experience of day-to-day combat. An essential ticket (2:40). Belasco Theater, 111 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)'MARY POPPINS' This handsome, homily-packed, mechanically ingenious and rather tedious musical, adapted from the P. L. Travers stories and the 1964 film, is ultimately less concerned with inexplicable magic than with practical psychology. Ashley Brown, who sings prettily as the family-mending nanny, looks like Joan Crawford trying to be nice and sounds like Dr. Phil. (2:30). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)'LES MIS?ABLES' This premature revival, a slightly scaled-down version of the well-groomed behemoth that closed only three years ago, appears to be functioning in a state of mild sedation. Appealingly sung and freshly orchestrated, this fast-moving adaptation of Victor Hugo's novel isn't sloppy or blurry. But its pulse rate stays well below normal (2:55). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)* 'PRELUDE TO A KISS' Craig Lucas's broken-hearted romantic comedy from 1990 receives a first-rate remounting, courtesy of the Roundabout Theater Company. Alan Tudyk and Annie Parisse play a young couple whose marriage founders shortly after the bride receives a kiss from an elderly stranger (John Mahoney). The kiss awakens all three to an unsettling awareness of love's frailty and, paradoxically, of its durability too (2:00). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212) 719-1300. (Charles Isherwood)* 'SPRING AWAKENING' Duncan Sheik and Steven Sater's bold adaptation of the Frank Wedekind play is the freshest and most exciting new musical Broadway has seen in some time. Set in 19th-century Germany but with a ravishing rock score, it exposes the splintered emotional lives of adolescents just discovering the joys and sorrows of sex. Performed with brio by a great cast, with supple direction by Michael Mayer and inventive choreography by Bill T. Jones (2:00). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)* 'TALK RADIO' The most lacerating portrait of a human meltdown this side of a Francis Bacon painting. Playing an abrasive radio talk show host with a God complex, the astounding Liev Schreiber seems to fill the air as inescapably as weather in Robert Falls's gut-grabbing revival of Eric Bogosian's 1987 play (1:40). Longacre Theater, 220 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)* 'TRANSLATIONS' The estimable Irish director Garry Hynes (a Tony winner for Martin McDonagh's ''Beauty Queen of Leenane'') has assembled an ensemble of an extraordinarily high caliber and consistency for the third major New York production of Brian Friel's 1980 play. Set in Ireland in 1833, as the local tongue is being supplanted by the language of the English occupying forces, the play explores the seriocomic truth that language can divide as easily as it unites, and can never hope to translate the rich music in our souls with the delicacy we yearn for. A top-flight Broadway revival (2:15). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)Off Broadway'BILL W. AND DR. BOB' This insightful new play about the founders of Alcoholics Anonymous subtly makes the claim that the recovery movement was born as a series of accidents. Patrick Husted is excellent as Bob Smith, Bill Wilson's partner in combating addictions (2:15). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Ginia Bellafante)'BLINDNESS' Joe Tantalo's adaptation of Jos?aramago's best-selling novel, about an unnamed city struck with an inexplicable epidemic of ''white blindness,'' is set in a cell-like space surrounded by white scrim. This setting and the mostly strong acting drive home the fearful basic circumstances. Unfortunately, the script also streamlines Mr. Saramago's reflective story to the point of draining it of moral complexity (1:30). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200. (Jonathan Kalb)'THE CAVE DWELLERS' This revival of William Saroyan's 1957 play about a group of misfits inhabiting an abandoned theater examines the virtue of charity and the nobility of failure but feels as stifling and constricted as the building in which the outcasts find themselves. A production that asks us to revere the theater without inviting reverence itself (1:30). Pearl Theater, 80 St. Marks Place, East Village, (212) 598-9802. (Bellafante)'CHICKEN' Michael Batistick's new play about cock fighting and emasculation could benefit from subtler metaphors but manages to touch us gently even as it deploys a heavy hammer. E J Carroll, Michael Imperioli and his ''Sopranos'' castmate Sharon Angela give fine performances as struggling urban nobodies (1:45). Studio Dante, 257 West 29th Street, Chelsea, (212) 868-4444. (Bellafante) (1:45)'DEFENDER OF THE FAITH' This grim tale by Stuart Carolan of low-level I.R.A. agitators trying to identify the informer in their midst features some visceral performances and a set by Charles Corcoran that makes excellent use of the Irish Rep's small stage. If only the cause itself didn't feel so small in these days of global terrorism (1:30). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737. (Neil Genzlinger)'THE DIRECTOR' A likable if na? young woman, who is seduced by an unnamed, unseen and presumably unscrupulous film director, seeks other of his victims and tape records their experiences for no clear purpose in a play that has no clear idea of what it wants to say (1:30). Flea Theater, 41 White Street, between Broadway and Church Street, TriBeCa, (212) 352-3101. (Wilborn Hampton)* 'DYING CITY' Christopher Shinn's crafty and unsettling play about grief and violence, set in the shadow of the Iraq war. Directed by James Macdonald and fiercely acted by Pablo Schreiber and Rebecca Brooksher, this quiet, transfixing production turns passive aggression into a theatrical dynamic. (1:30). Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater, 150 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-7600. (Brantley) 'THE FANTASTICKS' A revival -- well, more like a resuscitation -- of the Little Musical That Wouldn't Die. This sweet-as-ever production of Tom Jones and Harvey Schmidt's commedia-dell'arte-style confection is most notable for Mr. Jones's touching performance (under the pseudonym Thomas Bruce) as the Old Actor, a role he created when the show opened in 1960. Mr. Jones also directs (2:05). Snapple Theater Center, 210 West 50th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'GUTENBERG! THE MUSICAL' A very funny if not terribly original satire of musical theater features what must be the worst backers' audition of all time. (2:05). Actors' Playhouse, 100 Seventh Avenue South, at Fourth Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 239-6200. (Jason Zinoman)* 'IN THE HEIGHTS' Lin-Manuel Miranda's joyous songs paint a vibrant portrait of daily life in Washington Heights in this flawed but enjoyable show. Essentially a valentine to the barrio -- conflict of a violent or desperate kind is banished from the picture -- the musical contains a host of vibrant, funny performances and brings the zesty sound of Latin pop to the stage. (2:10). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Isherwood)* 'JACK GOES BOATING' Bob Glaudini's gentle comedy about pothead losers in love is a reminder of how engrossing uneventful lives can be in the hands of the right actors. Peter DuBois directs the easygoing ensemble, brilliantly led by Philip Seymour Hoffman (2:00). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555. (Brantley)* 'KING HEDLEY II' The Signature Theater Company concludes its season dedicated to August Wilson with a gritty, strongly cast revival of this play set in a violence-ravaged Pittsburgh in the 1980s. Russell Hornsby gives a galvanizing performance in the title role, as a man struggling to live down the errors of his past and plant the seeds for a promising new life (2:45). Peter Norton Space, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 244-7529. (Isherwood)'LOS ANGELES' Julian Sheppard's play about a gamin lost in a Hollywood of aimlessness and empty sex is as thin as the slip dress she keeps wearing and, presumably, taking off (1:20). Flea Theater, 41 White Street, between Broadway and Church Street, TriBeCa, (212) 352-3101. (Bellafante)'MY TRIP TO AL-QAEDA' Lawrence Wright, author of a deeply researched book about the rise of Islamic terrorism, conducts a theatrical seminar about the events leading to the horror of 9/11. He combines a linear narrative of the development of Al Qaeda with reminiscences about the experience of writing the book. Absorbing, and chilling too (1:30). Culture Project, 55 Mercer Street, at Broome Street, SoHo, (212) 352-3101. (Isherwood)'NO CHILD'  Teachers will love Nilaja Sun's one-woman show about the challenges of teaching drama at Malcolm X High School (1:10). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Anita Gates)'ROOM SERVICE' The Peccadillo Theater Company puts a charge into this comedy from the 1930s, thanks to a brisk pace by the director, Dan Wackerman, and a dozen dandy performances. David Edwards is the would-be producer whose bills threaten to swamp his efforts to put a show on Broadway, and Fred Berman is particularly fine as his director (2:00). SoHo Playhouse, 15 Vandam Street, South Village, (212) 691-1555. (Genzlinger)* 'SPALDING GRAY: STORIES LEFT TO TELL' A disarming collage of selections from the monologues and journals of Mr. Gray, the ultimate stand-up solipsist, who died in 2004. Directed by Lucy Sexton, and read by five performers, none of whom resemble Mr. Gray, with an affection that shrewdly stops short of hero worship (1:30). Minetta Lane Theater, 18 Minetta Lane, Greenwich Village, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)'TALL GRASS' Brian Harris's three short plays, black farces all, are not nearly as slight as any sound-bite synopsis would have them seem. Here Harris, a former stock analyst, explores the alliances formed between love and brutality in scenarios in which the tension builds to culminating shock (1:30). The Beckett Theater, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200 (Bellafante)* 'THE TAMING OF THE SHREW' AND 'TWELFTH NIGHT' In these boisterous and inventive productions, from the London-based all-male Propeller Company, the poetry may be pretty, but the comedy definitely is not. The director Edward Hall uncovers the baleful underbelly in Shakespearean slapstick, memorably demonstrating that boys will be brutes. (Each is 2:40.) Harvey Theater, Brooklyn Academy of Music, 651 Fulton Street, Fort Greene, (718) 636-4100. (Brantley)'TEA AND SYMPATHY' The specter of the Ted Haggard scandal hangs over the Keen Company's revival of Robert Anderson's 1953 play about life in a psychologically stifling boys' boarding school. Girded by Jonathan Silverstein's skillful, understated direction, the play attains an unexpected timeliness as it evolves into a story about the dangers of sexual repression (2:00). Clurman Theater, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Bellafante)* 'WAKE UP MR. SLEEPY! YOUR UNCONSCIOUS MIND IS DEAD!' Richard Foreman's latest film-theater hybrid is a memorial service, of sorts, for the intuitive self, killed by a surface-worshiping world. It is also a dazzling exercise in reality shifting that is as invigorating as it is mournful (1:05). Ontological Theater at St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101. (Brantley)'THE WAITING ROOM' An amusing play about some uncomfortable truths a group of friends and relatives faces while sitting in a hospital waiting room. While it has its share of laughs, it has things to say about the importance of family, even those members you might wish were not a part of it (2:00). 45th Street Theater, 354 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Hampton)'WIDOWERS' HOUSES' An adaptation of George Bernard Shaw's play, updated to 1990s Harlem, tests the limits of credibility (1:40). Kirk Theater, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Zinoman)Off Off Broadway'JACKIE WITH A Z' Delectably outrageous (1:30). Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555. (Lawrence Van Gelder)'MEN OF STEEL' This darkly comic twist on super heroes is a loony guilty pleasure (2:00). Center Stage, 48 West 21st Street, Chelsea, (212) 352-3101. (Zinoman)'THE PIRATES OF PENZANCE' A joyful treat (1:30). JCC in Manhattan, Amsterdam Avenue at 76th Street, (212) 279-4200. (Van Gelder)Long-Running Shows'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden Theater, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25).

(Brantley)Last Chance'THE ATTIC' The playwright Yoji Sakate looks at hikikomori, the Japanese phenomenon in which teenagers retreat from society, isolating themselves for weeks, months and sometimes even years. With a deft ensemble cast, the results are illuminating, original and darkly funny. 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200; closes on Sunday. (Bellafante)'BAAL' The director Charmian Creagle's bright idea for staging Bertolt Brecht's often offensive first play -- about a poet and singer who is a monster of appetite -- was to cast the title role as a woman. The production is so poorly acted and drearily directed, however, that the casting does nothing to illuminate the play or open a meaningful inquiry into habitual reactions to it (2:15). Looking Glass Theater, 422 West 57th Street, Clinton, (212) 307-9467; closes on Sunday. (Kalb)'KING LEAR' Or ''Lear Lite,'' featuring New Age music; eye-soothing, color-coordinated costumes; and the charming Kevin Kline in the title role. Directed by James Lapine, this is a whimsical story-book production that feels perversely out of touch with the soul-wrenching depths of Shakespeare's most devastating tragedy (3:00). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555; closes on Sunday. (Brantley)'THE MADRAS HOUSE' A century-old drama about ''the woman question,'' this rare revival of Harley Granville Barker's fascinating play is more contemporary than you might think (2:30). Mint Theater, 311 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 315-0231; closes on Sunday. (Zinoman)'MARY ROSE' J. M. Barrie wrote this distaff variation on themes from ''Peter Pan'' in 1920, and it has mostly lain on the shelf since. A young English girl (an exuberant Paige Howard) acquires the odd habit of disappearing and reappearing some time later, untouched by time's passing. Gentle and melancholy, handsomely mounted by Tina Landau, ''Mary Rose'' is nonetheless itself touched by the mark of time (1:45). Vineyard Theater, 108 East 15th Street, (212) 353-0303; closes on Sunday. (Isherwood)'MOBY DICK -- REHEARSED' A gripping revival of Orson Welles's 1955 adaptation of Melville's classic (2:00). Richmond Shepard Theater, 309 East 26th Street, (212) 868-4444; closes on Sunday. (Zinoman)'PARTICULARLY IN THE HEARTLAND' You can almost feel the self-congratulation in the hearts and minds of the writers and performers of this surrealist ensemble piece as they try to understand how the Red states think and live. The results? A well-intentioned mess of emoting over the current political divides (1:30). Performance Space 122, 150 First Avenue, at Ninth Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101); closes on Sunday. (Bellafante)* 'THE VOYSEY INHERITANCE' David Mamet has cleanly and cannily adapted Harley Granville Barker's 1905 play about corruption in the genteel world of Victorian finance. An excellent cast and a sumptuous production bring extra immediacy to a tale of embezzlement and entitlement that feels as fresh as tomorrow's stock options (1:50). Atlantic Theater, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 239-6200; closes on Sunday. (Isherwood)MoviesRatings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles.

(Manohla Dargis)* 'BEHIND THE MASK: THE RISE OF LESLIE VERNON' (R, 92 minutes) Scott Glosserman's mockumentary about a celebrity-seeking serial killer is sustained by rapier-sharp observations and a firmer grasp of tone than that in many more generously financed projects. Appealing more to the brain than the gut, the movie subtly prods at the sick dance between the news media and ?-criminals without belaboring its point or lowering its tone. If Christopher Guest ever turned his attention to psycho killers instead of folk singers and dog breeders, this is exactly the sort of movie he would make. (Jeannette Catsoulis)'BLACK SNAKE MOAN' (R, 116 minutes) Christina Ricci as a Tennessee nymphomaniac and Samuel Jackson as the blues singer who tries to cure her by fastening her half-naked self to his radiator with a chain. In spite of that summary, it's mostly corny uplift, from Craig Brewer, who also wrote and directed the down-home pimp fairy tale ''Hustle & Flow.'' (A.O. Scott)'BLOCKADE' and 'AMATEUR PHOTOGRAPHER' (No rating, 78 minutes total running time) Two short movies assembled from archival material explore the siege of Leningrad and the eastern front during World War II. (Stephen Holden)'BREACH' (PG-13, 110 minutes) In his fine, no-nonsense account of the capture of the F.B.I. agent-turned-mole Robert Philip Hanssen, the director Billy Ray manages to excite and unnerve despite our knowing the ending. Chris Cooper and Ryan Phillippe star. (Dargis)* 'BRIDGE TO TERABITHIA' (PG, 95 minutes) Grounded more in reality than in fantasy, this adaptation of Katherine Paterson's novel offers an affecting story of a transformative friendship between two gifted children. Beautifully capturing a time when a bully in school can loom as large as a troll in a nightmare, the director, Gabor Csupo, keeps the fantasy in the background to find magic in the everyday. (Catsoulis)'A JOURNEY OF DMITRY SHOSTAKOVICH' (No rating, 75 minutes) A documentary grab bag of film clips, diary readings and desultory narration, ''A Journey of Dmitry Shostakovich'' peeks at the politics of this controversial composer through a flurry of archival curiosities. But in their struggle to portray a man compromising his art to save his life, the directors, Oksana Dvornichenko and Helga Landauer, adopt a scattershot approach that's ultimately as ambiguous and impenetrable as its subject. (Catsoulis)'DEAD SILENCE' (R, 90 minutes) In this new film from the makers of the ''Saw'' series, a young man (Ryan Kwanten) whose wife was murdered by a demonic ventriloquist's dummy returns to his hometown to unravel the roots of a century-old curse. The film's playfully self-aware touches (like a grand old theater named the Guignol) distract from its leaden pacing, three too many final twists and various behavioral idiocies. (Matt Zoller Seitz)'EXTERMINATING ANGELS' (No rating, 100 minutes, in French) The French director Jean-Claude Brisseau's film is a piece of highbrow smut about a French filmmaker directing a piece of highbrow smut. A must for fans of highbrow smut. No complaints here. (Scott)* 'THE HOST' (R, 119 minutes, in Korean) A loopy, feverishly imaginative genre hybrid -- part carnival of horrors, part family melodrama -- about the demons that haunt us from without and within. The talented South Korean filmmaker Bong Joon-ho directs his monster and humans with equal flair. (Dargis)'I THINK I LOVE MY WIFE' (R, 94 minutes) An unusually smart and brisk comedy of marital frustration and sexual temptation, based on Eric Rohmer's ''Chloe in the Afternoon,'' with Chris Rock (who directed and is co-author of the script) as a Manhattan investment banker distracted by the charms of a bombshell played by the wonderful Kerry Washington. (Scott)* 'INTO GREAT SILENCE' (No rating, 162 minutes, in English and Latin) Philip Gr?g's documentary about the lives of Carthusian monks living in a valley in the French Alps is slow, quiet and utterly spellbinding for the way it conveys the experience of spiritual devotion in simple, lovely images. (Scott)'MUSIC AND LYRICS' (PG-13, 96 minutes) Drew Barrymore and Hugh Grant phone in passable impersonations of themselves in this competent romantic comedy, which is somewhat enlivened by parodies of bad pop songs from both the 1980s and the present. (Scott)'NORBIT' (PG-13, 97 minutes) Eddie Murphy plays a nebbish, a fat woman and a Chinese restaurant owner in this crude, sometimes mean, but often funny farce. (Scott)'THE NAMESAKE' (PG-13, 122 minutes) Color is the stuff of life in the movies of Mira Nair, the Indian-born director whose newest film, adapted from Jhumpa Lahiri's popular novel, follows two generations of a Bengali family from late-1970s Calcutta to New York City. Her lush palette lends her films a throbbing physicality that invites you to step into the screen and embrace the sensuous here and now. (Holden)NOMAD: THE WARRIOR' (R, 111 minutes) This epic adventure film from Kazakhstan is about attempts to unify that country in the 18th century, but it sure does look like an old-fashioned American western. A reasonably good western, all things considered, despite a formulaic plot and a high clich?ount in the dialogue. Horses, horses, horses, dazzlingly handled. (Neil Genzlinger)'THE NUMBER 23' (R, 95 minutes) An accidental comedy starring a deadly serious Jim Carrey that owes something to David Fincher, a little something else to Robert Anton Wilson and next to nothing, at least intentionally, to the gods of laughter, be they Gelus (Greek) or Jerry Lewis (American). (Dargis)'PREMONITION' (PG-13, 97 minutes) This sloppy, absent-minded psychological thriller scrambles time in the life of a desperate housewife (Sandra Bullock) whose husband is dead one day, alive the next. (Holden)'STARTER FOR TEN' (PG-13, 96 minutes) This amiable, nostalgic British comedy tackles a lofty subject -- the allure of knowledge --with down-to-earth charm, following a working-class kid (James McAvoy) during his first year at Bristol University and an appearance on the TV quiz show ''University Challenge.'' But beneath the formulaic embarrassments and fumbled learning curve lurks a more somber theme: the inevitable rupture between those who pursue an education and those left behind. (Catsoulis)'300' (R, 116 minutes) Greeks versus Persians in the big rumble at Thermopylae, via Frank Miller's graphic novel. As dumb as they get. (Scott)'WILD HOGS' (PG-13, 100 minutes) Tame slop. (Scott)* 'THE WIND THAT SHAKES THE BARLEY' (No rating, 127 minutes) Stringent, serious history from Ken Loach, in which the Irish uprising and Civil War of the early 1920s test the loyalties and consciences of two brothers, played by Cillian Murphy and Padraic Delany. (Scott)* 'ZODIAC' (R, 158 minutes) David Fincher's magnificently obsessive new film tracks the story of the serial killer who left dead bodies up and down California in the 1960s and possibly the '70s, and that of the men who tried to stop him. Set when the Age of Aquarius disappeared into the black hole of the Manson family murders, ''Zodiac'' is part police procedural, part monster movie, a funereal entertainment that is a testament to this cinematic savant's gifts.

It pays. Alan Arkin plays their father, a troublesome but well-meaning old coot. Writing in The Times, A. O. Scott noted the movie's similarities to ''Little Miss Sunshine'' -- a setting in Albuquerque, a beat-up old van, a get-rich-quick scheme, family dysfunction and Mr. Arkin -- and called it ''less a free-standing independent film than a scrap-metal robot built after a shopping spree at the Park City Indie Parts and Salvage Warehouse.''

4fd2b72d8eb7c8105d8ab702,2010-08-09 00:00:00 UTC,Opinion,"THE news of the day often includes an item about some development in artificial intelligence: a machine that smiles, a program that can predict human tastes in mates or music, a robot that teaches foreign languages to children. This constant stream of stories suggests that machines are becoming smart and autonomous, a new form of life, and that we should think of them as fellow creatures instead of as tools. But such conclusions aren't just changing how we think about computers -- they are reshaping the basic assumptions of our lives in misguided and ultimately damaging ways. In fact, the nuts and bolts of A.I. research can often be more usefully interpreted without the concept of A.I. at all. For example, I.B.M. scientists recently unveiled a ''question answering'' machine that is designed to play the TV quiz show ''Jeopardy.'' Suppose I.B.M. had dispensed with the theatrics, declared it had done Google one better and come up with a new phrase-based search engine. This framing of exactly the same technology would have gained I.B.M.'s team as much (deserved) recognition as the claim of an artificial intelligence, but would also have educated the public about how such a technology might actually be used most effectively. Another example is the way in which robot teachers are portrayed. For starters, these robots aren't all that sophisticated -- miniature robotic devices used in endoscopic surgeries are infinitely more advanced, but they don't get the same attention because they aren't presented with the A.I. spin. What bothers me most about this trend, however, is that by allowing artificial intelligence to reshape our concept of personhood, we are leaving ourselves open to the flipside: we think of people more and more as computers, just as we think of computers as people. What all this comes down to is that the very idea of artificial intelligence gives us the cover to avoid accountability by pretending that machines can take on more and more human responsibility. This holds for things that we don't even think of as artificial intelligence, like the recommendations made by Netflix and Pandora. Seeing movies and listening to music suggested to us by algorithms is relatively harmless, I suppose. But I hope that once in a while the users of those services resist the recommendations; our exposure to art shouldn't be hemmed in by an algorithm that we merely want to believe predicts our tastes accurately. These algorithms do not represent emotion or meaning, only statistics and correlations. What makes this doubly confounding is that while Silicon Valley might sell artificial intelligence to consumers, our industry certainly wouldn't apply the same automated techniques to some of its own work. Choosing design features in a new smartphone, say, is considered too consequential a game. Engineers don't seem quite ready to believe in their smart algorithms enough to put them up against Apple's chief executive, Steve Jobs, or some other person with a real design sensibility.",The First Church of Robotics,0,0,2,3,3,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,2,1,0,3.388888888888889,4.5,"  damaging to humanity AI marketing failure          worried that people will only start consuming what has been recommended to them and not step outside the box.

Activities / Procedures:1. WARM-UP/ DO-NOW: Prior to class, arrange desks in pairs. Upon entering class, students respond to the following as a pair (written on the board prior to class): Play a game of tic-tac-toe with your partner. Then, think about these questions together, and write down your answers: What are the rules of tic-tac-toe? What decisions does a player need to make before taking a turn? How would you verbally describe each of those decisions?۝ After a few minutes, ask the students to share with the class some of their responses. What kinds of statements are used to describe the rules and moves of the game? 2. As a class, read and discuss Robot Competitors Meet on a Soccer Field of Dreams,۝ focusing on the following questions:  a. What makes the international soccer tournament described in this article unusual?  b. According to the article, what are the short-term and long-term goals of this competition?  c. Who founded this competition, and why?  d. What other robot teams will the knowledge gained in this competition help foster, according to the article?  e. What are the four different leagues in the RoboCup?  f. What does Manuela M. Veloso mean when she says, We can۪t pre-program everything۝? g. How did the teams practice before the competition? For what were the teams practicing?  h. How long does it take to build a team of robotic soccer players? What is involved in doing this?  i. What are teams required to share after each year۪s competition? 3. Explain to students that they will be working in pairs to write an application (a string of basic computer code) for robots to enable them to play tic-tac-toe. They will then be competing in the first annual RoboTic-Tac-Toe Tournament.۝ Begin by returning to the earlier discussion of the rules of tic-tac-toe. What goals does each player have? Who starts the game? Is there a best place۝ to put the first X? What are some winning strategies for the next move? For example, If the X is in the center, then where should I put an 0?۝ Why is if-then۝ logic a good way to explain strategy for a simple game like tic-tac-toe? Now, further consider the if-then۝ statement. Ask students to share some if-then۝ statements about everyday situations, and write a few on the board (such as if I stay up late, then I am tired the next day۝ or if I jump in the mud, then I get my shoes dirty.۝) How do the terms if۝ and then۝ govern a logical sequence? Does an if-then statement need to be true? (Technically, no. The words if-then۝ define a cause and effect sequence, not a truth. It might be possible to state If I stay up late, then my shoes get muddy.۝ However, this is not a true or logical statement.) What, then, makes an if-then statement for tic-tac-toe true? (In tic-tac-toe, the rules of the game determine whether the if-then statement is true. For example, it would not be possible to truthfully state, If there is an X in the center, then place four O۪s in each corner.۝) To show how an if-then statement can be applied to tic-tac-toe, demonstrate the opening move for a game of tic-tac-toe on the board. Draw a nine-space grid and label the squares one through nine. Then ask the students where to place the first X. Depending on where it is placed, have students create an if-then statement that determines the next move. For example, If the first X is in the center, place an O in a corner square.۝ This is the first command in an application for the robot. What would the next line of code be? Ask students to work in pairs to complete the application. Each line of code in the entire sequence will cover every possible combination of moves the students can think of until a game is completed. Students need to remember that there are multiple options for each move (including the beginning move, which could be the placement of an X in the center, a corner, or in the middle of one of the outer perimeters of the grid.) They should consider all of the possibilities in developing their code. 4. WRAP-UP/HOMEWORK: Students complete their application and practice playing tic-tac-toe following only the commands they have written. They should debug۝ their program in preparation for the RoboTic-Tac-Toe Tournament۝ to be held in a future class. During the tournament, each team۝ (pair of students) will be acting as a single robot programmed by the application they developed; one student will read a command from their application, and the other student will execute the command. Teams play against each other, testing how successful their code is. Each game should be observed by the rest of the class and monitored to ensure the teams only execute the commands read.

WARM-UP/DO NOW: Students respond to the following prompt in their journals (written on the board prior to class): Think about the following items: a cheese grater, a vacuum cleaner, a CD disc changer, a battery-operated car, a regular car, and a desktop computer. Which of these items would you consider to be a robot? Why do you think each item is or is not a robot?۝ After a few minutes, allow students to share their answers, and tally student responses on the board for each item. Is there a consensus on what qualifies as a robot? What is a robot? What characteristics and features do robots have that other machines do not? 2. As a class, read and discuss When Nerds Collide: Robots at War,۝ focusing on the following questions:  a. According to the author, what draws viewers to BattleBots۝? b.

What device allows such light machines to hold them to the surface?  g. What does the author suggest might be the real source۝ of the appeal of robot battles? Do you agree? Why or why not? 3. Explain to students that they will be working in groups, acting as teams of engineers to design robots that will complete everyday tasks or household chores (tying a shoe, emptying the trash, etc.) Divide students into small groups of three or four, and have each group spend five minutes determining the answers to the following questions (one student should act as the group۪s secretary۝): What task will the robot accomplish? How is this task currently done without the robot? How will the robot do it better? After five minutes, have each group share their ideas. Then, organize each group around a computer with Internet access, and have them explore The Tech۪s online robot exhibit, which describes the five main parts usually found in a robot (http://www.thetech.org/exhibits_events/online/robots/5main/). After they have toured the exhibit and feel that they understand these components, groups should discuss how these five parts will function in their robots, focusing on the following questions (written on the board for easier student reference):  -Sensor: What will the robot sense? What information about the environment will it gather and feed back to the controller?  -End effector: What specific tasks will the robot perform?  What tools will it manipulate?  -Drive: How will the robot move? What power source will drive the robot functions?  -Arm: How will the robot۪s end effector and sensor be positioned? What degree of freedom will the robot arm(s) need to perform the task?  -Controller: How will the other four parts be controlled? Create a schematic that accounts for the signal pathways that control each part of the robot. What type of program might direct these signals? After these engineering aspects have been determined, each team creates a presentation poster that illustrates and explains the function of the five essential parts of their robot. Groups should also include a summary statement that explains what the robot will do and why it will do it better than conventional technology. 4. WRAP-UP/HOMEWORK: Allow students to finish their presentation posters. They should also create a model (working or non-working) of their robot to better explain its functions. In a future class, teams should present their designs and models. Allow students to question other design teams about their concepts and to offer constructive suggestions. As homework, each student revisits the six items they considered at the beginning of the lesson  a cheese grater, a vacuum cleaner, a CD disc changer, a battery-operated car, a regular car, and a desktop computer  and respond in writing to the following prompt (written on the board or copied for easier student access):  Based on what you have learned about the five essential parts of a robot, which of these items qualifies as a robot, and which do not? Explain your answer for each by noting which of the five components it has and how each part works.۝ Evaluation / Assessment:Students will be evaluated based on written journal entries, participation in class and group discussions, thoughtful annotated group poster and model of robot design, group presentation, and thoughtful completion of a final writing assignment. Extension Activities:1. Using cardboard, foam core, wire, and other materials, create a more detailed model of the robot designed in class. How does a static model differ from a functional prototype? What would be required to create a functional prototype of your robot? Investigate ways to make your robot work, and try to create a functional prototype. 2.

WARM-UP/DO NOW: In this initial classroom activity, students will respond to the production quality of recorded music played on two different types and qualities of music devices. Play the same piece of music for students  once on a cassette player and once on a CD player (try to use as old and inexpensive a tape player, and as new and advanced CD player, as possible). Keep the two music players hidden beneath a cloth or thin blanket so that the students cannot see what devices are being used. Then, in their journals, students respond to the following prompt (written on the board prior to class): Can you hear a difference between the two recordings? How would you describe the difference? What do you think accounts for the differences you perceive?۝ After a few minutes, allow students to share their responses. Then, reveal the two players and discuss the following: Who guessed the different technologies correctly? When do you think each device was first invented? How much money do you think each device cost when it was first introduced to the public? Are the differences between new products and their most recent versions always discernible? Why or why not? 2.

Does the author give you enough information about these improvements? Why or why not?  g. What is the chief virtue of the latest ViaVoice speech-recognition program? Is it clear why this feature is an improvement? Why or why not?  h. What are some of the features of the remaining products that the article mentions? Which of these features are easy to understand, and which ones do you not understand?  i. Do you think a geek۝ is someone who understands all these terms? 3. Divide the class into five groups, and explain that each group will be working as a team of product managers helping to develop a new personal electronic device. Explain that product managers typically serve as the liaisons between engineering teams, who design the products, and sales teams, who are directly responsible for selling the products. Product managers must be savvy about both the technology and the features that will make the most difference to consumers. Assign each group a different product category: digital cameras, handheld devices (PDAs), portable music devices, speech recognition programs and home robotic devices (such as robo-pets, yard bots, or roving house monitors). Each group begins by visiting an online electronics catalog, such as Cnet (http://www.cnet.com), and identifying three specific products in their category  one inexpensive, one moderately priced, and one top-of-the-line.۝ Next, students should examine the basic specs۝ (specifications) for the individual products (as well as the what to look for۝ descriptions for their category on CNet), and create a list of product specifications common to all three products in the category. (For example, while the number may vary, all the digital cameras include a specification for megapixels.۝) After creating a specification list, divide it among the students in the groups so that each student will research and write the definitions for one or more specifications. In each definition, students should describe the technology behind the feature (how does it work?), as well as explain why a consumer would want more (or less) in the product (what is its value?). 4. WRAP-UP/HOMEWORK: Each group writes a category assessment plan۝ for the product category they researched in class, responding to the following (written on the board to be copied): As a product management team for an electronics company, write a report that summarizes what is considered to be state-of-the-art۪ in your product category.

Learn about the latest autonomous vehicles participating in the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency۪s Grand Challenge by reading and discussing the article Robotic Vehicles Race, but Innovation Wins.۝  3. Propose ideas that would make directly controlled robotic devices more antonymous.  4. Create and present posters illustrating their ideas. Activities / Procedures:1.WARM-UP/DO-NOW: Prior to class, arrange an area in the front of the room to display several robotic and non-robotic items, or photographs of such items. Upon entering class, students should respond to the following prompt in their journals (written on the board prior to class): Fold a piece of paper in your journal in half. Label the left column Robots۪ and the right column Non-Robots.۪ Think carefully about the everyday items in the front of the room, and write their names in the appropriate columns. Add three other everyday items to each column. Then, answer the following questions: What is a robot? What qualities do all robots share?۝ After a few minutes, ask students to share their ideas and record them on the board for use later in the class period. Explain that a robot is essentially a smart۝ machine, or, more precisely a device that automatically performs complicated and often repetitive tasks۝ (http://www.webster.com) after programmed by humans. Explain that these everyday machines are examples of directly-controlled robotic devices۝; although they seem smarter۝ than ordinary machines, they cannot think or act on their own. Inform students that they will now read an article about a more sophisticated robot, a fully autonomous robotic device.۝ 2. As a class, read and discuss the article Robotic Vehicles Race, but Innovation Wins۝ (http://www.nytimes.com/learning/teachers/featured_articles/20050915thursday.html), focusing on the following questions:  a. What kind of car is Stanley?  b. What is the name of the Pentagon۪s research arm?  c. What course did the Pentagon set up for robots to complete nearly 18 months ago?  d.

What high school team is also participating?  v. What did William L. Whittaker mean when he said that he didn۪t know whether this year۪s race would be more like Lindbergh landing in Paris or more like Woodstock۝? 3. Explain to students that according to Tom Sugar, a robot maker and assistant professor of Mechanical Engineering at Arizona State University, There are three aspects to robots. Robots need to do sensing, just as we need to sense our environment. They must be able to make decisions based on that sensing information. And they must be able to take action based on those decisions۝ (http://researchmag.asu.edu/stories/robots.html). Write these three components on the board: Sense the Environment, Make Decisions Based on Sensing, Take Actions Based on Decisions. Ask students to think back to the article. What did the automated car need to sense? What decisions did it make in response to sensory information? What action did the car take based on each decision? Make sure students understand what differentiates the robotic devices listed during the Warm-Up activity from the robotic vehicles read about in the aritcle: the vehicles are fully automated robotic devices that require limited to no human input. Remind students that, during the final course, the programmers will have no communication with their racing vehicles. Explain to students that they will be developing design improvements for everyday robots to increase their autonomy and usefulness. Ask students to form pairs and instruct each pair to choose one of the robotic devices listed on the board from the Warm-Up activity. Each pair should then answer the following questions about their robot (copied on a handout or written on the board for easier student access:  -What does the robot do?  -What basic steps must the robot complete in order to perform the task?  -What information in the environment must the robot sense?  -What decisions does the robot make upon processing the sensory information?  -What action or actions does the robot then carry out?  -Think of three new tasks that you would like your robot to perform. For each one, identify what information in the environment it must sense, what decisions it must then make, and what actions it must then take.  -Given these ideas, would this robot as a fully automated robot provide better service than the original version? Why or why not? Who, in particular, might it help? It may be useful to provide this example for students: At the same time each night, a fully-automated microwave might sense the presence of food, automatically turn on, heat the food to the desired degree. stop, open its door automatically, close it again if the food had not been retrieved within five minutes, and keep the food warm until it is finally removed. This device might benefit people who work late and want to have dinner ready the minute they return. 4. WRAP-UP/HOMEWORK: Each pair creates an informational poster in which they sketch the original robot and the redesigned device, using arrows and text to describe features, abilities and improvements. Students should present their ideas to the class.

WARM-UP/DO NOW: Before class, write the following prompt on the board (and, if possible, cover it up to reveal it after the initial activity): Was this activity difficult and why? What signals was your brain receiving during the activity? How did your brain interpret and translate the signals into an action? Did the game get easier with practice and why?۝ Begin by playing a short action game in which the visual clue and the oral clue given to students do not match. For example, you might tell students to pat their knee۝ at the same time you pat the top of your head. Or you might tell students to touch their nose۝ while you touch your ear. Instruct students to only do the action that you say aloud. After a few rounds of the game, have students respond to the prompt in their journals. Discuss students۪ reactions and prior knowledge they have about how the brain sends and receives messages. What do you know about how the brain and nervous system work? 2. As a class, read and discuss the article Monkey۪s Thoughts Propel Robot, a Step That May Help Humans۝ (http://www.nytimes.com/learning/teachers/featured_articles/20080115tuesday.html), focusing on the following questions:  a. Why is this experiment a significant advancement in the field of brain research and robotics? b. What would a brain machine interface۝ do?  c. What are the potential applications of the research conducted with Idoya?  d. What steps are necessary before this kind of interface is usable in humans?  e. What is implied by Dr. Nicolelis۪s statement, That۪s one small step for a robot and one giant leap for a primate۝?  f. What parts of Idoya۪s brain were responsible for motion?  g. How did Idoya demonstrate the ability to create new neural connections in her brain?  h. How did Idoya۪s brain activity show that she was controlling the robot۪s motion? 3. Have students work in small groups to make a quick sketch diagramming the set up and implementation of the experiment as detailed in the article. Encourage groups to visualize how the thoughts of the monkey in North Carolina caused the robot in Japan to move. How was the brain machine interface used to translate the brain activity of the monkey to control the movements of the robot? Then, have students compare their sketches to the New York Times Image Moving by Thought,۝ found online at http://www.nytimes.com/imagepages/2008/01/14/science/20080115_monkey.html. Discuss the steps in the diagram to further clarify the innovation described in the article. Then tell students that they will research how the brain controls the movement of the body by sending and receiving messages, focusing on the brain activity and muscle movements in humans that cause motion. These are similar to the brain activity and movement of the monkey that scientists monitored and recorded in the experiment. In their small groups, have students begin by brainstorming a list of voluntary actions they use on a daily basis, such as walking, chewing, running, jumping, writing, turning their head, driving or picking up a book. Then, the group should choose one motion and work together to create a diagram mapping how the brain and nervous system are responsible for this motion. Diagrams should include the brain and the parts of the central and peripheral nervous systems, including the structure and function of neurons and sensory receptors. Instruct students to use labels, numbers and text boxes to describe clearly the sequence of events necessary for the voluntary action to occur. Next, explain that they should apply what they learn about the brain and nervous system in the research phase of the activity to make and add details to their diagram. Provide the following general questions to guide students۪ research, and remind students consider how the brain initiates motion, reacts to sensory stimuli and causes continuous fluid actions. GUIDING QUESTIONS -What parts of the body are involved in the action?  -What are the different parts of the brain and nervous system? -What specific parts of the brain are activated during a voluntary movement? How do they coordinate to produce voluntary motions? -What are the parts of a neuron? How do neurons transmit messages to and from the brain?  -How is sensory information collected by the body and transmitted to the brain during motion? Why is this information necessary for movement?  -If a brain machine interface were used, where in the brain would electrodes most likely be implanted to control the desired motion? The level of detail required in the diagrams should depend on the students۪ ability level. For example, beginning students might state that a signal is transmitted from the motor cortex of the brain, through the spinal cord and peripheral nervous system to the muscles of the arm,۝ while advanced students might also describe the electrochemical activity responsible for transmitting signals across the synapses between neurons. When small groups are ready, have students present their diagrams to the class. Have students from other groups do the action in slow motion while the group explains the brain activity involved in the fractions of a second it takes the brain to chew, take a step, pick up a pencil or throw a ball. Could the classmates act out the motion using the description? Does anything need to be added, deleted, clarified, or otherwise changed in the diagram? Before the end of class, have students imagine what it might be like to have a disability, such as paralysis or a mobility-limiting injury or affliction. Have students how the brain interface technology described by the article might help people with these disabilities in the future, such as helping a stroke victim regain clear speech. Then, in preparation for the homework, have students brainstorm other possible uses for this technology, such as eliminating the need for workers such as miners or astronauts to physically enter potentially dangerous situations or enhancing a virtual۝ video game to a new level. 4. WRAP-UP/HOMEWORK: Individually, students should respond to the following prompt (provided before students leave class): Dr. Nicolelis said, We have shown that you can take signals across the planet in the same time scale that a biological system works. Here the target happens to be a robot. It could be a crane. Or any tool of any size or magnitude. The body does not have a monopoly for enacting the desires of the brain.۪ Using this quote, your imagination, and what you learned about the physiology of movement in class, write a one-page proposal outlining an idea for a science fiction story, comic book series or screenplay. Describe the characters, include a plot summary and hypothesize potential problems that characters might encounter. Include a detailed account of how you will explain the science behind the brain motion interface to give the story a realistic element and make it seem plausible.۝ Extension Activities:1.

I couldn۪t stomach the cartoons or anything like that.It didn۪t concern you that you were about to make a movie about a toy?Here۪s the thing: I don۪t consider this a toy. It۪s not. To me, it۪s the farthest thing from it. It was about the mythology, and that there was a story here. The mythology is really deep, it goes 25 years back. And what I liked was, the code of the warrior. Optimus Prime had a lot of samurai things to him. I۪m thinking, if I make this very real, and do something very real in terms of effects, then that might be very interesting. It was always about the boy and the car. And that was what Steven said, and I always liked that concept. It۪s such a seminal moment in a kid۪s life. That۪s your sense of freedom and whatnot. There was just this image of a boy hiding this alien robot in his garage or his house or his backyard that just stuck with me. I۪m thinking, O.K., that۪s the heart and soul of the movie, for the first one. From there we kind of branched out.

Mori۪s theory is relatively simple. We tend to reject robots that look too much like people.  Slight discrepancies and incongruities between what we look like and what they look like disturb us.  The closer a robot resembles a human, the more critical we become, the more sensitive to slight discrepancies, variations, imperfections.  However, if we go far enough away from the humanoid, then we much more readily accept the robot as being like us.  This accounts for the success of so many movie robots  from R2-D2 to WALL-E.  They act like humans but they don۪t look like humans.  There is a region of acceptability  the peaks around The Uncanny Valley, the zone of acceptability that includes completely human and sort of human but not too human. The existence of The Uncanny Valley also suggests that we are programmed by natural selection to scrutinize the behavior and appearance of others.

I was in a rather remarkable auto accident six years ago, which involved me accidentally piloting an old Honda Accord off of a 50-foot drop-off at 80 m.p.h. In the middle of nowhere in Pennsylvania. At midnight on a Thursday.Somehow, after an airborne flight that took out trees mid-trunk, and left the car crumpled from every direction into a tangled mess of steel, I was able to climb out, crawl up the embankment, and walk half a mile before finally being able to get help.Though I looked like a mess, and the paramedics who saw the crash site were split between amazement and a conviction that I must have some sort of severe internal injury, I managed to escape with nothing but some superficial cuts, and a broken collarbone.But I never experienced the sort of euphoria or feeling of a second chance۝ that you describe. If anything, I was actually rather irritated that the accident prevented me from taking a job offer I۪d received and was unable to delay.Is it because I۪m a strict atheist? Is it because my fascination with probability and quantum mechanics have rendered me amused, but never shocked, by the most bizarre occurrences? I۪m not sure. I just know that all I have control over are my own actions and responses  and even those are as likely to be guided by instinctual reaction as by any conscious effort.Death is nothing to be terrified of. What goes up, must come down. What is born, must die. It۪s beyond my understanding why anyone would need a near-death experience to realize this, or to appreciate the joys of living we only get to experience for such a finite time. Posted by DaveLet Me Count the WaysI was nearly killed once.It scared the hell out of me. It still scares me to know just how near death we are. And I don۪t mean: a sudden shock followed by a radiant, calming insight into the wholeness of whatever. I mean helpless entrapment in horrific, mutilating agony: being pulled into a machine, burned alive, impaled, eaten by an animal, strapped inside a crashing plane, drowning, falling from a lethal height, poison gas. Anything that takes a while and is so awful, so painful that you۪re reduced to reflexes, and they۪re not enough.Whenever I get a peek at how near that kind of death is (it۪s happening to somebody else right this second), I cling to whatever I۪ve got the same way a jaw will hold on even to rotten teeth.I always feel at least a little grace when the wheel of death stops for anybody but me. There۪s always a moment when I۪m brushing my teeth or eating my breakfast when I think, Is this the day I head out the door like it۪s any other day and walk right into my own death? So far so good, for me. But somewhere somebody is running errands and taking care of business and getting nearer every second to the worst possible way to die.I۪ve never felt grace without vertigo afterward. Posted by MikeWasted GraceSeveral years ago I worked with a nasty, abusive man who was widely disliked by everyone who knew him. By a quirk of fate (a minor accident with a luggage cart at the airport, requiring medical attention for his 10-year-old son), this man, his wife, and their two children missed a flight that crashed a few hours later, killing everyone aboard. All of us who suffered the miseries of working with this individual were certain he would return a changed man, but no such thing happened. He was as awful as ever, apparently ungrateful for the grace of having been spared this terrible tragedy.Go figure. Posted by Laurie BrennerA GiftGrace following a near-death experience is indeed a gift, one that will bring clarity and greater peace, if you remember it often. The calm strength my friends and family seem to admire in me must have come from surviving being struck by a car as a pedestrian in my twenties. My husband survived his own accident last year, against all odds, as a bicyclist hit by a driver in an S.U.V. He is still recovering, and the chronic pain he۪s experiencing dulls the euphoria he might otherwise feel post-trauma. But there is no doubt he has changed, and evolved, into someone who values personal relationships above all else. It is amazing to me that so many very fortunate people worry and complain about the their daily lives. Tim Kreider۪s advice is terrific: try to rise through the clouds every day to find that glimpse of grace. It will bring you both perspective and happiness. Posted by Marjorie PiersonNo RegretsEight years ago I was in a very bad car accident, and now I am paralyzed from the waist down permanently.I still remember that moment, while I was being tumbled around like a rock as the truck rolled, me in the bed of the truck with a camper shell on it, when I was positive that I was going to die. I was asleep when the first crash hit, and I woke up to chaos. I didn۪t know what was going on, or how much longer I had.Then came the loudest sound I have ever experienced, along with the hardest crash; I became the sound, became the crash, there was no me anymore, just a collection of atoms being blasted apart. The next thought I had, that came from somewhere deep, was WAIT!۝ As in, I۪m not done yet, I۪m just getting started, please don۪t!And that was the ego-breaker. That realization that there was an end to life, to my life. There really was a finish line, a finite amount of time, and I had done nothing with it so far. Many priorities begin to shift.That sense of my life being finite has never left me. Sometimes I am incredibly grateful for it  it helps me to constantly reassess my priorities. Sometimes it makes my life hell  because the end is coming, and I know it, and I can do nothing about it. The car accident left me with some PTSD, and I also have had depression all my life. So even though I know that every moment is a gift, I am often frustrated because many times it seems I cannot use that gift. Chronic pain does not help.But I would not give the whole experience up. I have learned amazing things about life and about myself; becoming severely disabled has allowed me to feel much more empathy for people. Having a spinal cord injury is like falling down the rabbit hole: everything becomes unrecognizable, every solid ground becomes shaken. You۪d be amazed at the things you learn when you find out that everything you know is wrong. Posted by Laurie C.",More Light!,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.0,2.0,  ,

What kind of information did they need to find out? How did the students respond to setbacks? How did they divide and share the work? What did they succeed in being able to do at the competition? What else did you notice as you watched? Be sure students understand that every function a robot carries out needs to be programmed. In both the Lego and dancing humanoid videos, for example, computer programs give the robots directions telling them how to move. (Some robots in the field of artificial intelligence do “learn,” based on rules written into computer programs.) When the teams have completed their research and have designed their robots, have them develop a pitch to try to sell their idea to an agency۝ that funds research and development in science and technology. Tell them their pitch should include a product name and logo, information about the challenge they۪ve identified, sketches and descriptions of their robot, and the solution their robot offers.

Next, tell students they will now work in small groups to identify a challenge or problem for a robot to solve in one of the following aspects of daily life: school and education, the home, medicine and health care, media and communication, entertainment, sports, transportation, hospitality, manufacturing, science and engineering, and exploration. (Feel free to add to the list or to have students brainstorm their own; you might assign one sphere to each group to ensure that students are tackling a variety of problems and situations.) Encourage students to be creative  they may think of challenges in their own day-to-day life where a robot could be helpful, or they may think of workplaces and industrial settings that could benefit from robots. Alternatively, students choose one of the items from the list of tasks from the warm-up, research how robots perform in one of these settings and design their own robot to perform a different function in the same setting.

Berkeley and author of “What Computers Can’t Do,” would say about this new work. The editors and I have invited him and Sean Dorrance Kelly, professor and chair of the department of philosophy at Harvard University and co-author, with Professor Dreyfus, of “All Things Shining:  Reading the Western Classics to Find Meaning in a Secular Age,” to reply. — Stanley Fish In last week’s column, Stanley Fish argued that Watson ain’t so smart.  Watson, of course, is the IBM-built computer that recently won a game of “Jeopardy!”  Despite this impressive achievement, Fish argued that Watson “does not come within a million miles of replicating the achievements of everyday human action and thought.”  In defending this claim, Fish invoked arguments that one of us (Dreyfus) articulated almost 40 years ago in “What Computers Can’t Do,” a criticism of 1960s and 1970s style artificial intelligence. Some of the most interesting comments on Fish’s column pointed out that AI research today is based on a dramatically different paradigm, and that therefore the old arguments against it no longer have any bite.  We agree.  And we agree also, as a number of other comments suggested, that Watson’s ability to process natural language, to resolve linguistic ambiguities and to evaluate the puns, slang, nuance and oblique allusions characteristic of a typical “Jeopardy!” question or category is impressive indeed.  Nevertheless, the arrival of our new computer overlords is not exactly around the corner. To begin with, consider the way things used to be.  At the dawn of the AI era the dominant approach to creating intelligent systems was based on finding the right rules for the computer to follow.  If you wanted a computer to play checkers, for instance, then you just needed to code up a system that had rules for how the pieces could move, had a rule about how to rank possible board positions and could generate a tree of possible board positions based on a given initial move.  The philosopher John Haugeland, a former student of Dreyfus’s, called this rule-based approach GOFAI, for Good Old Fashioned Artificial Intelligence. For constrained domains the GOFAI approach is a winning strategy.  Already in the early 1960s researchers had developed a system that could play master-level checkers.  And a few years ago it was announced that checkers has been solved. Dozens of computers, running almost continuously since 1989, mapped completely the 500 billion billion possible positions in the game of checkers, rendering it no more interesting than tic-tac-toe.Even Deep Blue, the IBM system that beat the then-reigning world champion chess master Garry Kasparov in 1997, followed something like this brute force strategy.  Chess is a much more complicated game than checkers, with an estimated 10∧120 possible positions, so it cannot be solved in the way that checkers has.  But Deep Blue could follow out all the consequences of a given move to a depth of 20 or more possible responses, and this proved sufficient.  Still, as commenter Bruce Macevoy  and others point out, this is nothing like what humans do.  And most AI researchers agree that there is nothing intelligent or even interesting about the brute force approach. In many ways the AI community has taken this criticism to heart.  As Lisa from Orlando points out, the dominant paradigm in AI research has largely “moved on from GOFAI to embodied, distributed intelligence.”  And Faustus from Cincinnati insists that as a result “machines with bodies that experience the world and act on it” will be “able to achieve intelligence.” The adaptive, responsive, biologically inspired robots that Brooks and others have built may not inhabit the same world that we humans do.  And to the extent that they have purposes, projects and expectations they are probably not much like ours.  For one thing, although they respond to the physical world rather well, they tend to be oblivious to the global, social moods in which we find ourselves embedded essentially from birth, and in virtue of which things matter to us in the first place.  Despite these perhaps insurmountable deficiencies, we find this approach to be a possible step in the right direction.  But whether or not it is ultimately successful, the embodied AI paradigm is irrelevant to Watson.  After all, Watson has no useful bodily interaction with the world at all.

4fd39eac8eb7c8105d8e1995,2011-03-11 12:52:33 UTC,Health,"According to the study, when a hospital acquires surgical robots, men in that region are more likely to have surgery to treat prostate cancer than before the technology was acquired. Buying a robot led to an average increase of 29 operations a year per hospital. Meanwhile, hospitals that didn۪t invest in robots performed an average of five fewer operations annually. Although large hospitals may perform hundreds of such operations a year, many of the local and regional hospitals in the study see no more than 100 to 150 cases a year, the study authors said. One reason for the increase in operations in hospitals that own a surgical robot may be that the technology helps a hospital lure potential surgical patients away from the competition. But the data also suggest that once a hospital obtains a robot, patients who might be candidates for nonsurgical options are more likely to be steered toward robotic surgery instead. Surgical robots are expensive. A surgical robot used for prostate cancer costs $1 million to $2.25 million, according to the N.Y.U. study. In addition, hospitals spend $140,000 annually for a service contract and $1,500 to $2,000 per patient on disposable instruments. The new study, conducted by researchers at New York University and other institutions, tracked surgical robot purchases at 554 hospitals, along with the treatment given to more than 30,000 men given a prostate cancer diagnosis from 2001 to 2005.

Some technologists enthusiastically extrapolate from the observation that computing power doubles every 18 months to predict an imminent “technological singularity” in which a threshold for machines of superhuman intelligence will be suddenly surpassed. Many Singularitarians assume a lot, not the least of which is that intelligence is fundamentally a computational process. The techno-optimists among them also believe that such machines will be essentially friendly to human beings. I am skeptical about the Singularity, and even if “artificial intelligence” is not an oxymoron, “friendly A.I.” will require considerable scientific progress on a number of fronts.The neuro- and cognitive sciences are presently in a state of rapid development in which alternatives to the metaphor of mind as computer have gained ground. Dynamical systems theory, network science, statistical learning theory, developmental psychobiology and molecular neuroscience all challenge some foundational assumptions of A.I., and the last 50 years of cognitive science more generally. These new approaches analyze and exploit the complex causal structure of physically embodied and environmentally embedded systems, at every level, from molecular to social. They demonstrate the inadequacy of highly abstract algorithms operating on discrete symbols with fixed meanings to capture the adaptive flexibility of intelligent behavior. But despite undermining the idea that the mind is fundamentally a digital computer, these approaches have improved our ability to use computers for more and more robust simulations of intelligent agents — simulations that will increasingly control machines occupying our cognitive niche. If you don’t believe me, ask Siri. This is why, in my view, we need to think long and hard about machine morality. Many of my colleagues take the very idea of moral machines to be a kind of joke. Machines, they insist, do only what they are told to do. A bar-robbing robot would have to be instructed or constructed to do exactly that. On this view, morality is an issue only for creatures like us who can choose to do wrong. People are morally good only insofar as they must overcome the urge to do what is bad. We can be moral, they say, because we are free to choose our own paths. There are big themes here: freedom of will, human spontaneity and creativity, and the role of reason in making good choices — not to mention the nature of morality itself.

Google’s servers can comb through billions of Web sites in a split second, but they’re indifferent to what those sites say, and can’t understand a word of them. Siri may find the nearest bar for you, but “she” neither approves nor disapproves of drinking. The word “bar” doesn’t actually mean anything to a computer: it’s a set of electrical impulses that represent nothing except to some human being who may interpret them. Today’s “artificial intelligence” is cleverly designed, but it’s no closer to real intelligence than the letter-writing automatons of the 18th century. None of these devices can think, because none of them can care; as far as we know there is no program, no matter how complicated, that can make the world matter to a machine. So computers are anything but human — in fact, they’re well below the level of an ant.

Video cameras guide them through feats well beyond the capability of the most dexterous human. But the arms seem eerily human when they reach over to a stand and change their hand۝ to perform a different task. While the many robots in auto factories typically perform only one function, in the new Tesla factory a robot might do up to four: welding, riveting, bonding and installing a component. About 10 feet tall, the arm has the grace and dexterity of a skilled supermarket bagger, twisting and turning each case so the final stack forms an eight-foot cube. The software is sophisticated enough to determine which robot should pick up which case first, so when the order arrives at the supermarket, workers can take the cases out in the precise order in which they are to go on the shelves. Older robots cannot do such work because computer vision systems were costly and limited to carefully controlled environments where the lighting was just right.

An unusual new study of college students۪ interactions with a robot has shed light on why we intuitively trust some people and distrust others. While many people assume that behaviors like avoiding eye contact and fidgeting are signals that a person is being dishonest, scientists have found that no single gesture or expression consistently predicts trustworthiness.

(The extra time was needed to help the student get over the wow۝ factor of talking to a robot.)

This is the second election where the projection of Mr. Obama winning the presidency fell during the hour when Mr. Stewart was performing his live show on Comedy Central.

JEREMY W. PETERS11:57 P.M.The Tense Moments at ABC News Were BackstageJust before 11 p.m., a pivotal hour for presidential election coverage, the power went out inside ABC۪s tricked-out studio above Times Square.The lights around Diane Sawyer and George Stephanopoulos۪s desk flickered off. So did the lights that powered a huge video screen on the floor.Major technical failure,۝ the ABC News president Ben Sherwood called it.ABC covered up the blackout by having another anchor, Josh Elliott, interview voters in Times Square. Then Ms. Sawyer tossed to a commercial and the executives began troubleshooting.Tell our anchors what is happening,۝ Mr. Sherwood said before asking an engineer, What۪s the prognosis?۝ The engineer said he didn۪t know how many minutes the lights would stay off.In the front row of the control room  which still had power  the director Jeff Winn tried to quiet his concerned colleagues: Everybody calm down, O.K.? We۪re going to be O.K.۝During the break the anchors moved over to the one corner of the studio that still had light and power. They stood there, talked about the electoral vote map, tossed to correspondents in the field, and hid their frustration whenever the cameras were pointed at them.Around 11:15 p.m., when the full studio regained power, they slid back to the anchor desk with nary a mention of the dramatic failure behind the scenes.There was plenty of chatter on Twitter about Ms. Sawyer, who viewers noticed was off her game. Ms. Sawyer repeatedly slurred her words, and on at least one occasion called Mr. Elliott by the wrong name.Some people at ABC had an explanation: Ms. Sawyer was simply exhausted. The network had no official comment about the Twitter chatter, except to say that her successful anchoring during a prolonged blackout of her studio spoke for itself. BRIAN STELTER11:44 PMCompared to TV, Twitter Is a Silent RiotThe crescendo started shortly after 11:00 p.m., as the television networks started to call the election for President Obama. Predictably, Twitter was a blitz of all kinds of messages: celebratory, personal, coldly analytical, snarkily told-you-so. But all that activity on the computer screen could not match the emotional response that was happening in the background of all the television networks, as the the crowds at Obama headquarters in Chicago began to cheer louder and louder in the background. Even Fox News, which called the election with dour faces and remarks that Romney was a loser in this race,۝ turned its cameras to the revelry in Chicago. On television the sound of victory is contagious. So far, Twitter can۪t match that visceral impact.

One early scene on CNN had a host walking in a virtual-reality legislative chamber. But for the most part the on-screen technology has been less retro-futuristic than iPad utilitarian, with lots of swiping, pinching and pulling of maps and voting tallies. Perhaps the most charming visual gimmick has been the Empire State Building۪s real-time display of CNN۪s projections in Romney red۝ and Obama blue.۝Even Will.i.am seemed a little disappointed by the lack of progress:.@andersoncooper .@cnn People keep tweeting me and asking me: what are you guys going to do this year to top 2008 #hologram???۝ will.i.am (@iamwill) November 7, 2012 BEN SISARIO10:21 P.M.Texting the NewsAmong the many ways voters can get voting results tonight: text message.Several media outlets are sending out texts when states are projected for President Obama and Mitt Romney.

In the past few days I۪ve been part of the diaspora in search of warmth and light. I stayed in New York last night and looked nervously out the window today at the long lines at the Port Authority. With New Jersey Transit trains mostly down, the buses there have been stretched in the extreme and there were rumors that it would take four hours to actually get on a bus. As it turned out, I was able to grab a ride with a friend and the power is back on, but I opted earlier to take New Jersey up on its offer of voting by fax or e-mail. It was on odd mix of old school  I needed help to remember how to operate a fax machine  and newish technology  I mean, I just voted through a wire. (The e-mail route in my county involved scanning and creating PDF۪s and then sending the digital package off to a clerk۪s personal Hotmail account, which sort of freaked me out.)But part of the ritual of participating in a national election is that you get to do something very local and very palpable, which is to go into a booth, draw the curtain, then pull a lever. The act of voting makes the act of watching later all the more exciting, because you have the fresh recollection that among all those numbers thrown around on television, at least one of those votes belongs to you.It doesn۪t feel that way when you vote by fax. The machine hummed, the three pages zoomed through the machine and, one hopes, there was someone at the other end to notch my vote. But there was none of the solid clunk of pulling the big lever at the bottom of the booth to register my participation.It wasn۪t the same. I am a reporter, but I am also an American, and one of the things that makes watching the results so riveting is that I played a very tiny, but very real role in the story of the day.

At 9:04 p.m., the paper sent out an alert saying that Mitt Romney had won his native state of Michigan and credited The Associated Press with the story.

In recent years, however, literature has lost a lot of ground on that score to evolutionary psychology, neurobiology and computer science, and particularly to the efforts of artificial intelligence researchers. So as we wait for the Singularity, when our iPhones will become sentient and Siri will start telling us what we can do for her, many of the savvier fiction writers have begun to come to grips with the fact that the tutelary spirit of the quest for the human may not be Dante or Emily Dickinson or Virginia Woolf, but Alan Turing, the British mathematician who helped start the revolution in computing. Turing may be best known for his version of the Victorian-era Imitation Game, in which a judge receives written responses to his questions from a man and a woman behind a screen and tries to guess from the answers which is the man and which the woman. In Turing’s version, the messages are from a human and a computer; it was his contention that when a judge couldn’t tell the difference any longer, then a machine could be said to think like a human being. The Turing test has since become, at least in the popular imagination, the holy grail of artificial intelligence developers, as well as a conceit in contemporary fiction, and that conceit is at the heart of Scott Hutchins’s clever, funny and very entertaining first novel, “A Working Theory of Love.” The novel’s wisecracking narrator is Neill Bassett Jr., a 30-something native of Arkansas who now lives the life of a rootless metrosexual in San Francisco. Though he’s not a scientist, he makes up one-third of a tiny computer start-up in Menlo Park, alongside an Indonesian programmer named Laham and their boss, an elderly European genius named Henry Livorno, who are working to create an artificial intelligence for a planned Turing test (which seems to be based on the annual Loebner Prize). Livorno has incorporated software into his computer that evokes the seven deadly sins, but more important, he has also loaded into its memory the 5,000-page diary of Neill’s father — the “Samuel Pepys of the South” — an Arkansas doctor who killed himself when Neill was 19. Neill’s job, as the real Dr. Bassett’s son, is to participate in a series of conversations with the programmed “Dr. Bassett” in order to make — its? his? — responses more lifelike.

No surprise if he’d been the driver, perhaps (never tell a taxi driver that you’re a philosopher!), but this was a man who has spent his career with computers. I knew of the suggestion that A.I. might be dangerous, of course. I had heard of the “singularity,” or “intelligence explosion”– roughly, the idea, originally due to the statistician I J Good (a Cambridge-trained former colleague of Alan Turing’s), that once machine intelligence reaches a certain point, it could take over its own process of improvement, perhaps exponentially, so that we humans would soon be left far behind. But I’d never met anyone who regarded it as such a pressing cause for concern – let alone anyone with their feet so firmly on the ground in the software business. I have now met many fascinating scholars – scientists, philosophers and others – who think that these issues are profoundly important, and seriously understudied. Strikingly, though, they differ about where they think the most pressing risks lie. A Cambridge zoologist I met recently is most worried about deadly designer bacteria, produced – whether by error or by terror, as Rees puts it – in a nearby future in which there’s almost an app for such things. To him, A.I. risk seemed comparatively far-fetched – though he confessed that he was no expert (and added that the evidence is that even experts do little better than chance, in many areas). Where do I stand on the A.I. case, the one that got me into this business? I don’t claim any great expertise on the matter (perhaps wisely, in the light of the evidence just mentioned). For what it’s worth, however, my view goes like this. On the one hand, I haven’t yet seen a strong case for being quite as pessimistic as Jaan Tallinn was in the taxi that day. (To be fair, he himself says that he’s not always that pessimistic.) On the other hand, I do think that there are strong reasons to think that we humans are nearing one of the most significant moments in our entire history: the point at which intelligence escapes the constraints of biology. And I see no compelling grounds for confidence that if that does happen, we will survive the transition in reasonable shape. Without such grounds, I think we have cause for concern. Objections to this claim come from several directions. Some contest it based on the (claimed) poor record of A.I. so far; others on the basis of some claimed fundamental difference between human minds and computers; yet others, perhaps, on the grounds that the claim is simply unclear – it isn’t clear what intelligence is, for example. But there’s a more direct answer, too, to this attempt to take comfort in any supposed difference between human minds and computers. It also cuts against attempts to take refuge in the failure of A.I. to live up to some of its own hype. It’s an answer in two parts. The first part – let me call it, a little aggressively, the blow to the head – points out that however biology got us onto this exalted peak in the landscape, the tricks are all there for our inspection: most of it is done with the glop inside our skulls. Understand that, and you understand how to do it artificially, at least in principle. Sure, it could turn out that there’s then no way to improve things – that biology, despite all the constraints, really has hit some sort of fundamental maximum. Or it could turn out that the task of figuring out how biology did it is just beyond us, at least for the foreseeable future (even the remotely foreseeable future). But again, are you going to bet your grandchildren on that possibility? The second part of the argument – the blow from below – asks these opponents just how far up the intelligence mountain they think that A.I. could get us. To the level of our fishy ancestors? Our early mammalian ancestors? (Keep in mind that the important question is the pragmatic one: Could a machine do what these creatures do?) Wherever they claim to draw the line, the objection challenges them to say what biology does next, that no nonbiological machine could possibly do. Perhaps someone has a plausible answer to this question, but for my part, I have no idea what it could be. In Copenhagen the summer before last, I shared a taxi with a man who thought his chance of dying in an artificial intelligence-related accident was as high as that of heart disease or cancer.

And I see no compelling grounds for confidence that if that does happen, we will survive the transition in reasonable shape. Without such grounds, I think we have cause for concern. Objections to this claim come from several directions. Some contest it based on the (claimed) poor record of A.I. so far; others on the basis of some claimed fundamental difference between human minds and computers; yet others, perhaps, on the grounds that the claim is simply unclear – it isn’t clear what intelligence is, for example. But there’s a more direct answer, too, to this attempt to take comfort in any supposed difference between human minds and computers. It also cuts against attempts to take refuge in the failure of A.I. to live up to some of its own hype. It’s an answer in two parts. The first part – let me call it, a little aggressively, the blow to the head – points out that however biology got us onto this exalted peak in the landscape, the tricks are all there for our inspection: most of it is done with the glop inside our skulls. Understand that, and you understand how to do it artificially, at least in principle. Sure, it could turn out that there’s then no way to improve things – that biology, despite all the constraints, really has hit some sort of fundamental maximum. Or it could turn out that the task of figuring out how biology did it is just beyond us, at least for the foreseeable future (even the remotely foreseeable future). But again, are you going to bet your grandchildren on that possibility? The second part of the argument – the blow from below – asks these opponents just how far up the intelligence mountain they think that A.I. could get us. To the level of our fishy ancestors? Our early mammalian ancestors? (Keep in mind that the important question is the pragmatic one: Could a machine do what these creatures do?) Wherever they claim to draw the line, the objection challenges them to say what biology does next, that no nonbiological machine could possibly do. Perhaps someone has a plausible answer to this question, but for my part, I have no idea what it could be.","Cambridge, Cabs and Copenhagen: My Route to Existential Risk",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,10,1,1,0,7,4,1,2.4523809523809526,4.571428571428571," skepticism about AI, transportation risk      deadly designer bacteria                       Without such grounds, I think we have cause for concern.

The specifics on how the Academic Index is calculated or how it is evaluated from university to university are not made public. The formula for calculating individual A.I. numbers is not available on the league Web site or in any other official public forum — even if there are dozens of such calculators listed online (nearly all of them inaccurate). “We give our coaches a target A.I. average to meet, and they are very good at usually exceeding that. But yes, it will often lead to, well, negotiations.” Perhaps the most talked about goal of the A.I. is the academic credential minimum it establishes, a number below which virtually no Ivy League recruit can be admitted. This summer, that floor was raised from an Academic Index of 171 to 176, which roughly translates to a B student (3.0 on a 4.0 scale) with a score of 1140 on the old two-part SAT. (As seen in the accompanying chart, which is based on an academic index calculator obtained from league coaches and high school guidance counselors, broad estimates for calculating the A.I. can be made, but in practice, the A.I. usually uses a complex formula that takes into account SAT I and SAT II test scores or ACT scores in addition to high school grades issued on grade-point scales that vary from 4.0 to 12.0. To simplify the numerical comparisons in this article, all grades were based on a 4.0 scale and the SAT I scores listed will be fundamental, two-part math and verbal scores. The math score has a greater influence on the final index.) Harris said the A.I. this year was not raised so much as adjusted. Class rank was once part of the formula, with grade-point average used only if class rank was not available. But because many high schools stopped reporting class rankings in recent years, it was eliminated over the summer. Harris said the change was made because when admissions directors recalculated multiple A.I.’s under the new system, a candidate who typically reached a score of 171 was now a 176. It is also important to note that a 176 A.I. score is the lowest allowed, and that the number of recruits in any year admitted at that level is not plentiful. At the other end of the spectrum, virtually every coach interviewed had a story about a recruit with a 210 A.I. (a 4.0 student with roughly 1,300 on the two-part SAT) who was rejected for admission for various reasons — a poor interview, a sloppy essay, because the recruit had not taken chemistry since 10th grade or because the recruit’s transcript lacked enough Advanced Placement classes. One of the most misunderstood aspects of how the A.I. works is its fluctuation from institution to institution. Because the eight Ivy League members have varying academic standards and the basis for the athletic A.I. average is the overall student body, the average A.I. for the athletic cohort at Harvard, for example, is several points higher than the average at Brown. That means a soccer recruit with a 210 A.I. who is rejected at Harvard might be accepted at Brown. And the whole league knows it. “But in perspective, you have to realize we are dealing with a select group since Ivy League athletes are in the top 10 percent of all college applicants nationwide,” Goldberger said. “The average kid going to college across this country would have an A.I. of about 150.” “An institutional autonomy that allows schools to support sports that they believe have a greater chance of success is one of the reasons the A.I. works and is accepted,” said Steve Bilsky, the athletic director at Penn. “That’s a vital component.” The overall athletic A.I. can also be balanced by recruits with considerably higher A.I.’s who play other, lower-profile sports, or by recruits with exceedingly high A.I.’s who are stacked at the top end of a team’s roster. “We see it all the time, a team with an A.I. number over 200, but when you get down to it, who plays?” Jones said. “You can make your number whatever you want by recruiting kids just for their high A.I., and who cares if they play? It is done. Not here at Yale, but it is done.” Harris also explained that certain sports are scrutinized separately: football, basketball and ice hockey, in particular. Football teams, which are allowed to support an average of 30 recruits a year in the admissions process, are also regulated in four A.I. bands spaced from low to high, with each band’s A.I. rising by about 10 points. Al Bagnoli, the Penn football coach, said last year that he was given 2 spots in the lowest band, 8 in the second band, 12 in the third and 8 in the highest. Over all, there are hundreds of teams with A.I. averages well into the 200s. In a response to a commissioned report on Brown athletics issued this year, the university’s president, Ruth J. Simmons, said that for the four most recent admissions classes throughout the league, Brown had seven sports with average A.I.’s under 200; Dartmouth and Penn had 5; Columbia 3; Yale 1; and Harvard and Princeton none. Simmons did not mention Cornell in her written response.","Before Recruiting in Ivy League, Applying Some Math",0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.142857142857143,1.4047619047619049,                                         ,            Recruiting

Pincers, similar to those on insects, grip the power line to keep the robot from plunging to the ground while it lifts its two wheels off the power line and then swings them around to the other side of the obstruction. The action is more complex than it sounds and is controlled by an operator on the ground using a combination of handgrips, a video display and a touch-screen laptop computer. The research group decided that, because the robot would be largely made from conductive metals, it was better for it to become electrically charged than to insulate it from the electricity running through the lines. A charged robot eliminated the possibility of large and potentially damaging electrical arcs between the machine and the lines. Rubber, although it is an electrical insulator, is also the only material able to provide sufficient grip for the robot۪s wheels, its contact with the line. To solve that problem, researchers at Goodyear created a conductive rubber compound that includes silver.","To Inspect Live Utility Lines, Send In the Robots",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.0,4.111111111111111,        ,

For years, artificial-intelligence experts have insisted that machines can succeed as authors. But would we humans ever want to read the robot-books?

Parker believes that A.I.-produced books, issued in a dazzling array of languages, could be crucial to the spread of literacy. Think of farmers in Malawi who lack the most basic guides to agriculture in their own language. Parker talked about the need to distribute books aimed at people who speak underserved languages like Chichewa and Tumbuka. “One thing that’s missing is the content itself — the textbooks,” Parker said, and A.I. could offer a cheap solution. In the late 1990s, he began using automatic text-generation software to produce such books. More recently, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has financed Parker’s use of A.I. to produce weather reports for the radio in local languages. And, he added, what’s the point of using artificial intelligence to simulate the kind of work that humans enjoy?

519e26a746fdbf6c1db7806d,,Business; Technology,"To the degree there was a human face of Watson, the “Jeopardy!” computer champion, it was David Ferrucci. He was the I.B.M. researcher who led the development of Watson, an artificial intelligence engine. The goateed computer scientist was always articulate and at ease in front of a camera or a microphone. After Watson beat the best human Jeopardy champions in 2011, its artificial intelligence technology was directed toward new challenges, like assisting doctors in making diagnoses in a research project at the Cleveland Clinic. Dr. Ferrucci led that next-generation Watson research as well. But he went to Bridgewater at the end of last year. Bridgewater, a private company, made no announcement of its new hire. Yet word of Dr. Ferrucci’s departure from I.B.M. has been circulating among scientists in the artificial intelligence field. And I caught up with him recently for an interview, supplemented by a lengthy e-mail he titled, “My Reflections.” Dr. Ferrucci, 51, said he had “a great, great career” at I.B.M., spanning 20 years, and “they paid me very well.”He said he “never imagined myself at a hedge fund,” but eventually the appeal of working in a smaller environment in an entirely new field for him — applying artificial intelligence to macroeconomic modeling — won him over. Dr. Ferrucci said the more recent work he was doing at I.B.M., called WatsonPaths, was the direction he thought artificial intelligence research needed to go to make further advances, and it was the approach he saw Bridgewater pursuing to economic modeling. Much of artificial intelligence today, he said, focuses on mining vast amounts of data to make predictions. Those predictions are based on statistical probabilities and patterns — a certain symptom is highly correlated with a certain disease, for example. That approach is a hybrid of the Big Data tools, which sift through troves of medical literature, and logic tools to identify likely chains of inference — what humans see as logical explanations for the “why” of things. The approach is also a step in the direction of classic artificial intelligence, which relied on knowledge rules and relationships, to create so-called expert systems. The blend combines elements of what Dr. Ferrucci termed “my 30-year journey in A.I.”",Life After Watson For Researcher,0,0,1,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,3.523809523809524,4.0476190476190474,                    ,       researcher leaving IBM    macroeconomic modeling  optimism about AI's future

They are also collaborating with colleagues in the computer science department to personalize the interactions. Since MEDi has facial recognition capabilities, for example, one idea is for the robot to greet children by name at subsequent visits, or to program in responses received from parents ahead of time about children۪s favorite books. The robot, named MEDi, is programmed to greet a child with a high-five, collect toys from a tray and ask questions like Do you like movies?۝ Children who engaged with the robot while receiving a flu shot had much less pain and distress than children who got a shot the usual way, according to a study published in the June issue of Vaccine. It۪s the first robot to help children manage painful medical procedures,۝ said Tanya Beran, a professor of community health sciences at the University of Calgary in Alberta and the principal investigator of the study, which was conducted at Alberta Children۪s Hospital. Research suggests that children who experience distress in a medical setting at a young age are less likely to access health care in adulthood, so she says it۪s important to find ways to reduce pain during pediatric care.

All the high-resolution monitors and video effects, devoted to themes ranging from deep-sea-fishing expeditions to Spider-Man to the unsubtlest visions of cash washing over lucky winners, are only the most obvious signs of technology’s move onto the casino floor. Behind the scenes, server-based gaming now enables managers to rapidly alter payouts, raise or reduce betting minimums, even change games themselves. (In just minutes, a bank of slot machines styled for dance clubbers can be rethemed to appeal to church ladies on a Sunday afternoon.) But a few deceptively prim-looking machines represent an even greater technological leap, the biggest advance in automated gambling since Charles Fey introduced the one-armed bandit in 1895. They owe the way they play to artificial intelligence. The pokerbot, which takes on one challenger at a time, can trace its roots to the Norwegian Defense Research Establishment in Kjeller, Norway. Until 2002, that’s where an engineer named Fredrik Dahl worked on artificial intelligence for secret government projects on combat simulations. The job involved using neural networks. Functioning much like an extremely focused, one-dimensional version of the human brain, these complex computer algorithms develop strategies that emerge through so many repetitive mathematical calculations that few humans could reproduce, much less endure them. Dahl’s work on two-sided, zero-sum games, where there is no mutual interest, proved to be useful in developing strategies to win not only wars but also poker games. Hector Levesque, a professor of computer science at the University of Toronto who specializes in A.I., also sees the bigger picture for this sort of technology. “Pushing hard on statistics and learning [via neural nets] can have a big impact,” he says, while cautioning that that should not be mistaken for having the ability to think in the multidimensional, contextual sense. “The biggest technology coming out of A.I. is getting examples of reasonable behavior and learning from statistics. Google search does so well because it has to do with statistics and adjusts from that. Same with the driverless car.

Its evolutionary importance seems self-evident; typically, kids can do this by the time they۪re a year old. Elizabeth Croft, professor of mechanical engineering at the University of British Columbia, has done a study in which humans and robotic arms pass objects back and forth  a skill that would be important for a robot caregiver to get right. She has found that if a robot and a human reach for the same object simultaneously, and the robot never hesitates or varies its speed, people think the robot is being rude. When the robot makes little jerky motions and slows down, according to Croft, people actually describe this disembodied arm as considerate  maybe even a little shy. But this built-in gullibility has its downsides for robots, too. It۪s relatively easy to program a robot with behaviors that arouse our cognitive empathy, but this can create a dissonance in expectations once people figure out it۪s not as smart as it appears. A paper by David Feil-Seifer, assistant professor of computer science at the University of Nevada, Reno, briefly describes a study wherein a group of autistic children figured out that their new talking, moving robot pal really only had a limited number of phrases and behaviors in its repertory. They became disappointed۝  one child even stated that the robot was learning-disabled.۝ (This shouldn۪t be unfamiliar  consider the widespread derision and disappointment inspired by Siri, Apple۪s intelligent personal assistant.۝) The other problem is more philosophical. Our entire civilization is based on empathy,۝ Sharlin told me. Societies are built on the principle that other entities have emotions.۝ What happens when we start designing technologies specifically to exploit the very backbone of society?

5273bde479881079ff371cd6,,Books,"When the world chess champion Garry Kasparov was beaten in 1997 by Deep Blue, an I.B.M. supercomputer, it was considered to be a major milestone in the march toward artificial intelligence. It probably shouldn’t have been. As complex as chess is, it’s easy to see that its rules can be translated into algorithms so that computers, when they eventually got enough processing power, could crunch through billions of possible moves and past games. Deep Blue’s calculations were a fundamentally different process, most people would say, from the “real” thinking and intuition a human player would use. Thompson’s point is that “artificial intelligence” — defined as machines that can think on their own just like or better than humans — is not yet (and may never be) as powerful as “intelligence amplification,” the symbiotic smarts that occur when human cognition is augmented by a close interaction with computers. When he played in collaboration with a computer, Kasparov said, it freed him to focus on the “creative texture” of the game. In the future, Thompson writes, we should not fear being beaten in chess by Deep Blue or in “Jeopardy!” by Watson. Instead, humans will find themselves working in partnership with the progeny of these supercomputers to diagnose diseases, solve crimes, write poetry and become (as the clever double meaning of the book’s title puts it) smarter than we think. This is not a new idea. It is based on the vision expounded by Vannevar Bush in his 1945 essay “As We May Think,” which conjured up a “memex” machine that would remember and connect information for us mere mortals. The concept was refined in the early 1960s by the Internet pioneer J. C. R. Licklider, who wrote a paper titled “Man-Computer Symbiosis,” and the computer designer Douglas Engelbart, who wrote “Augmenting Human Intellect.” They often found themselves in opposition to their colleagues, like Marvin Minsky and John McCarthy, who stressed the goal of pursuing artificial intelligence machines that left humans out of the loop.",Brain Gain,0,0,2,2,3,2,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.4444444444444446,4.555555555555556,        ,

The implications of progress in A.I. are being brought into sharp relief now by the broadcasting of a recorded competition pitting the I.B.M. computing system named Watson against the two best human Jeopardy players, Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter. Further advances in both A.I. and I.A. will increasingly confront the engineers and computer scientists with clear choices about how technology is used. “There needs to be an explicit social contract between the engineers and society to create not just jobs but better jobs,” said Jaron Lanier, a computer scientist and author of “You are not a Gadget: A Manifesto.”",A Fight to Win the Future: Computers vs. Humans,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.3333333333333335,4.666666666666667,        ,

In other words, it must do more than what search engines like Google and Bing do, which is merely point to a document where you might find the answer. It has to pluck out the correct answer itself. Technologists have long regarded this sort of artificial intelligence as a holy grail, because it would allow machines to converse more naturally with people, letting us ask questions instead of typing keywords. Software firms and university scientists have produced question-answering systems for years, but these have mostly been limited to simply phrased questions. Nobody ever tackled “Jeopardy!” because experts assumed that even for the latest artificial intelligence, the game was simply too hard: the clues are too puzzling and allusive, and the breadth of trivia is too wide. By the end of the day, the seven human contestants were impressed, and even slightly unnerved, by Watson. Several made references to Skynet, the computer system in the “Terminator” movies that achieves consciousness and decides humanity should be destroyed. “My husband and I talked about what my role in this was,” Samantha Boardman, a graduate student, told me jokingly. “Was I the thing that was going to help the A.I. become aware of itself?” She had distinguished herself with her swift responses to the “Rhyme Time” puzzles in one of her games, winning nearly all of them before Watson could figure out the clues, but it didn’t help. The computer still beat her three times. In one game, she finished with no money. The great shift in artificial intelligence began in the last 10 years, when computer scientists began using statistics to analyze huge piles of documents, like books and news stories. They wrote algorithms that could take any subject and automatically learn what types of words are, statistically speaking, most (and least) associated with it. Using this method, you could put hundreds of articles and books and movie reviews discussing Sherlock Holmes into the computer, and it would calculate that the words “deerstalker hat” and “Professor Moriarty” and “opium” are frequently correlated with one another, but not with, say, the Super Bowl. So at that point you could present the computer with a question that didn’t mention Sherlock Holmes by name, but if the machine detected certain associated words, it could conclude that Holmes was the probable subject — and it could also identify hundreds of other concepts and words that weren’t present but that were likely to be related to Holmes, like “Baker Street” and “chemistry.” Ted Senator, a vice president of SAIC — a high-tech firm that frequently helps design government systems — is a former “Jeopardy!” champion and has followed Watson’s development closely; in October he visited I.B.M. and played against Watson himself. (He lost.) He says that Watson-level artificial intelligence could make it significantly easier for citizens to get answers quickly from massive, ponderous bureaucracies. He points to the recent “cash for clunkers” program. He tried to participate, but when he went to the government site to see if his car qualified, he couldn’t figure it out: his model, a 1995 Saab 9000, was listed twice, each time with different mileage-per-gallon statistics. What he needed was probably buried deep inside some government database, but the bureaucrats hadn’t presented the information clearly enough. “So I gave up,” he says. This is precisely the sort of task a Watson-like artificial intelligence can assist in, he says. “You can imagine if I’m applying for health insurance, having to explain the details of my personal situation, or if I’m trying to figure out if I’m eligible for a particular tax deduction. Any place there’s massive data that surpasses the human’s ability to sort through it, and there’s a time constraint on getting an answer.” Some scientists, moreover, argue that Watson has serious limitations that could hamper its ability to grapple with the real world. It can analyze texts and draw basic conclusions from the facts it finds, like figuring out if one event happened later than another. But many questions we want answered require more complex forms of analysis. Last year, the computer scientist Stephen Wolfram released “Wolfram Alpha,” a question-answering engine that can do mathematical calculations about the real world. Ask it to “compare the populations of New York City and Cincinnati,” for example, and it will not only give you their populations — 8.4 million versus 333,336 — it will also create a bar graph comparing them visually and calculate their ratio (25.09 to 1) and the percentage relationship between them (New York is 2,409 percent larger). But this sort of automated calculation is only possible because Wolfram and his team spent years painstakingly hand-crafting databases in a fashion that enables a computer to perform this sort of analysis — by typing in the populations of New York and Cincinnati, for example, and tagging them both as “cities” so that the engine can compare them. This, Wolfram says, is the deep challenge of artificial intelligence: a lot of human knowledge isn’t represented in words alone, and a computer won’t learn that stuff just by encoding English language texts, as Watson does. The only way to program a computer to do this type of mathematical reasoning might be to do precisely what Ferrucci doesn’t want to do — sit down and slowly teach it about the world, one fact at a time.",What Is I.B.M.’s Watson?,0,0,4,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,2,0,0,3.6666666666666665,4.866666666666667,             The only way to teach artificial intelligence is slow AI unable to full understand real world,AI is becoming more precise at answering questions posed by humans Watson     using statistics to analyze huge piles of documents     quicker information

Some in the blogosphere saw the acquisition differently, speculating that Google was buying DeepMind to help make robots and thermostats more intelligent — presumably for world domination. While this new artificial intelligence technology could be used with robots one day, possibly even in the not-too-distant future, for now, Google was hoping to continue its world domination of search. This is why Facebook was also competing to buy DeepMind, as The Information noted Monday. Facebook doesn’t have any humanoid robots, robotic dogs or Internet-connected thermostats. What Facebook does have is something that Google dominates: search. ReCode first reported the deal on Sunday, saying Google had agreed to pay $400 million for the company. People who work with Google but could not be named because they were not allowed to speak publicly for the company, said the acquisition of the artificial intelligence software had nothing to do with robots, but everything to do with semantic technology and the ability to understand what people were asking for online and answer in a very human way. While a Google spokesman confirmed the purchase of DeepMind, he declined to comment about why Google had acquired the company or the type of projects the new team of researchers and scientists would be working on. The DeepMind team will likely be working with Geoffrey Hinton, a computer scientist and psychologist who joined Google last year and works on the company’s Knowledge Graph. Mr. Hinton is best known for his work in the 1980s when he started research in machine learning — teaching computers to put data together in patterns that are very similar to the human brain. When Mr. Hinton joined Google, he wrote on his Google Plus page that he had spent time working with the Knowledge Graph team of scientists and engineers who, he thought, had a real shot at pushing machine learning into new territory. “I am betting on Google’s team to be the epicenter of future breakthroughs,” he wrote at the time. All of this Knowledge Graph work could eventually help people search in a way that was much closer to talking to another human, but with the answers of a robot. Deep Mind, which is based in London, was founded by Demis Hassabis, a computer-game designer, neuroscientist and former child chess prodigy, and his partners, Shane Legg and Mustafa Suleyman. Mr. Legg noted in a 2011 Q&A with the LessWrong blog that technology and artificial intelligence could have negative consequences for humanity. “Eventually, I think human extinction will probably occur, and technology will likely play a part in this,” Mr. Legg said. “If a super-intelligent machine (or any kind of super-intelligent agent) decided to get rid of us, I think it would do so pretty efficiently.” “I’d like to go on a vacation somewhere warm over the summer, but only have a budget of $1,000.

530198a87988102e37cb4c6e,,Business Day,"Jared Bernstein is a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities in Washington and a former chief economist to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.The economist Alan Blinder and I were recently discussing whether technology was making a serious dent in job growth. Technically, we were considering whether the pace at which labor-saving technology is entering the workforce has accelerated — that is, whether the likelihood of “technological unemployment” had grown — when he suggested this thought experiment:Today's EconomistPerspectives from expert contributors.Say you were Thomas Jefferson’s chief economist and you’d just somehow seen a report from the year 2013 showing that 1.5 percent of the workforce was in agriculture, as opposed to the 90 percent in your day. You ran to the president with news of this crisis, telling him we’ve got to start preparing for mass unemployment.Alas, like most similar warnings throughout history, yours would have been wrong. While productivity in farming has grown tremendously, displacing millions of workers, they’ve mostly found work elsewhere. That’s not at all meant to dismiss the disruption caused by technological progress on the lives of those displaced. It is simply to state that the predictions of the type we’re hearing more and more of — these days, about how robotics and digitized intelligence are finally going to cast us into unemployment in large numbers — have been wrong for centuries. Of course, that doesn’t mean they’re wrong now. And in fact, a few years ago I plotted some data points that surprised me and many others.  The plot simply compared the growth of productivity to that of employment (using “full-time equivalents” for the latter, so that two half-time jobs are counted as one full-time job). PhotoSources: Bureau of Economic Analysis and Bureau of Labor Statistics. Productivity is for nonfarm business sector; employment is for full-time equivalents (F.T.E.'s) in the private sector.  F.T.E. employment is available only through 2012, so the 2013 value is projected using private payroll employment and part-time employment for 2013.Credit The standard view, the one that dismisses Jefferson’s shocked economist, derives from the fact that the two lines track each other for decades. I’ll explain why that’s been true in a moment, but what’s surprising here is the fact that this decades-long relationship appears to have broken down in recent years. A natural question is whether that gap toward the end of the chart is the work of robots or other labor-displacing technologies of the type discussed by Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee in their compelling new book on this question, “The Second Machine Age.”Before we get to the split in the lines, let’s discuss the decades of uniform growth (and longer historical charts show the same thing). A tiny bit of math from a recent analysis by the economist Lawrence Mishel, a critic of the robots-are-coming hypothesis, turns out to be elucidating.First, Y = (Y/L)*L where Y is output, or gross domestic product, and L is hours worked, which you can think of as jobs. Now, with a bit more algebra, including taking natural logs, you quickly end up with:Job Growth = Output Growth — Productivity GrowthWith constant output growth, more efficient production (faster productivity growth) means fewer jobs, which is pretty much common sense: If we can produce the same output in fewer hours, we need less work to hold steady. But of course output has been anything but constant. The intervening variable, which has always glued those two lines together, is greater demand for the additional goods and services we can produce by dint of our increasing productivity. The fact that more efficient production typically lowers prices is a key part of the demand boost.Therefore, the first thing your average macroeconomist would think when looking toward the end of the figure above is not “robots!” It’s “weak growth!” And that, in fact, is what Mr. Mishel finds. Here are his annualized growth numbers to fill into the little formula above for the last two business cycles: 1989-2000 and 2000-2007 (of course, since 2007, both growth and jobs have been cyclically depressed). Remember, it’s job growth equals G.D.P. growth minus productivity growth.The 1990s: 1.5% = 3.3% — 1.8%The 2000s: 0.3% = 2.4% — 2.1%Looking to the right of the equal sign, what really changed in the 2000s was output growth, which fell almost a point (to 2.4 percent from 3.3 percent) over the period where the lines above diverge. Yes, productivity accelerated a bit, but had growth remained constant at 3.3 percent, we would have added jobs at a rate of 1.2 percent per year (3.3 percent minus 2.1 percent) instead of a measly 0.3 percent. That fourfold difference would have amounted to seven million more full-time jobs.So weak growth and demand is the culprit. But “weak demand” is itself a pretty amorphous explanation. Perhaps that maps onto the tech story, with capital equipment replacing workers faster than normal, so that there’s more unemployment, less consumer spending, and weaker output growth.Maybe, but that, too, is hard to see in the numbers, and it also has some tough competitors. That is, there are other explanations for the especially weak demand growth in the 2000s. Capital investment — spending on business equipment, including software and robotics — slowed in the 2000s relative to the 1990s, and while productivity accelerated slightly, it too has since slowed. On the other hand, Moore’s Law means that as time progresses, businesses can buy a lot more computing power for a lot less.Still, this line of reasoning hardly makes sense. If technological advances lead to both fewer jobs and less growth for the length of a whole business cycle, why undertake them?In fact, the 2000s were characterized by particularly large trade deficits that sapped domestic demand, along with a large and destructive increase in financial “innovation” that fueled a housing bubble from which we’re still recovering. True, the bubble spun off a construction boom and “wealth effect” that created some jobs in those years, but not enough to offset the slowdown in underlying demand. And again, exploding synthetic derivatives and a housing glut are not what the technologists have in mind when they analyze how robotics and artificial intelligence are improving the economy. Since that bubble burst, joblessness has been driven by cyclical forces and austere public policy.None of this is dispositive evidence against either President Jefferson’s economist or Mr. Brynjolfsson and Mr. McAfee, who present a lot of anecdotal indicators of labor-saving advances that could conceivably increase the rate of technological unemployment going forward. But for now, I see nothing in either the data or the anecdotes that leads me to conclude that labor-saving technology is preventing us from getting back to full employment. To explain that, I’d invoke a far more evident culprit: the damaging policy set that has brought us bubbles and busts coupled with political resistance to the necessary policies to help get things back on track.My argument regarding the question posed above is simple: Before we can assess the state of technological unemployment, we have to get rid of bad policy-induced unemployment. At that point, perhaps we can get a better handle on what the robots are really up to. In fact, the 2000s were characterized by particularly large trade deficits that sapped domestic demand, along with a large and destructive increase in financial “innovation” that fueled a housing bubble from which we’re still recovering. True, the bubble spun off a construction boom and “wealth effect” that created some jobs in those years, but not enough to offset the slowdown in underlying demand. And again, exploding synthetic derivatives and a housing glut are not what the technologists have in mind when they analyze how robotics and artificial intelligence are improving the economy. Since that bubble burst, joblessness has been driven by cyclical forces and austere public policy.

A tiny bit of math from a recent analysis by the economist Lawrence Mishel, a critic of the robots-are-coming hypothesis, turns out to be elucidating.First, Y = (Y/L)*L where Y is output, or gross domestic product, and L is hours worked, which you can think of as jobs. Now, with a bit more algebra, including taking natural logs, you quickly end up with:Job Growth = Output Growth — Productivity GrowthWith constant output growth, more efficient production (faster productivity growth) means fewer jobs, which is pretty much common sense: If we can produce the same output in fewer hours, we need less work to hold steady. But of course output has been anything but constant. The intervening variable, which has always glued those two lines together, is greater demand for the additional goods and services we can produce by dint of our increasing productivity. The fact that more efficient production typically lowers prices is a key part of the demand boost.Therefore, the first thing your average macroeconomist would think when looking toward the end of the figure above is not “robots!” It’s “weak growth!” And that, in fact, is what Mr. Mishel finds. Here are his annualized growth numbers to fill into the little formula above for the last two business cycles: 1989-2000 and 2000-2007 (of course, since 2007, both growth and jobs have been cyclically depressed). Remember, it’s job growth equals G.D.P. growth minus productivity growth.The 1990s: 1.5% = 3.3% — 1.8%The 2000s: 0.3% = 2.4% — 2.1%Looking to the right of the equal sign, what really changed in the 2000s was output growth, which fell almost a point (to 2.4 percent from 3.3 percent) over the period where the lines above diverge. Yes, productivity accelerated a bit, but had growth remained constant at 3.3 percent, we would have added jobs at a rate of 1.2 percent per year (3.3 percent minus 2.1 percent) instead of a measly 0.3 percent. That fourfold difference would have amounted to seven million more full-time jobs.So weak growth and demand is the culprit. But “weak demand” is itself a pretty amorphous explanation. Perhaps that maps onto the tech story, with capital equipment replacing workers faster than normal, so that there’s more unemployment, less consumer spending, and weaker output growth.Maybe, but that, too, is hard to see in the numbers, and it also has some tough competitors. That is, there are other explanations for the especially weak demand growth in the 2000s. Capital investment — spending on business equipment, including software and robotics — slowed in the 2000s relative to the 1990s, and while productivity accelerated slightly, it too has since slowed. On the other hand, Moore’s Law means that as time progresses, businesses can buy a lot more computing power for a lot less.Still, this line of reasoning hardly makes sense. If technological advances lead to both fewer jobs and less growth for the length of a whole business cycle, why undertake them?In fact, the 2000s were characterized by particularly large trade deficits that sapped domestic demand, along with a large and destructive increase in financial “innovation” that fueled a housing bubble from which we’re still recovering. True, the bubble spun off a construction boom and “wealth effect” that created some jobs in those years, but not enough to offset the slowdown in underlying demand. And again, exploding synthetic derivatives and a housing glut are not what the technologists have in mind when they analyze how robotics and artificial intelligence are improving the economy. Since that bubble burst, joblessness has been driven by cyclical forces and austere public policy.None of this is dispositive evidence against either President Jefferson’s economist or Mr. Brynjolfsson and Mr. McAfee, who present a lot of anecdotal indicators of labor-saving advances that could conceivably increase the rate of technological unemployment going forward. But for now, I see nothing in either the data or the anecdotes that leads me to conclude that labor-saving technology is preventing us from getting back to full employment. To explain that, I’d invoke a far more evident culprit: the damaging policy set that has brought us bubbles and busts coupled with political resistance to the necessary policies to help get things back on track.My argument regarding the question posed above is simple: Before we can assess the state of technological unemployment, we have to get rid of bad policy-induced unemployment. At that point, perhaps we can get a better handle on what the robots are really up to. In fact, the 2000s were characterized by particularly large trade deficits that sapped domestic demand, along with a large and destructive increase in financial “innovation” that fueled a housing bubble from which we’re still recovering. True, the bubble spun off a construction boom and “wealth effect” that created some jobs in those years, but not enough to offset the slowdown in underlying demand. And again, exploding synthetic derivatives and a housing glut are not what the technologists have in mind when they analyze how robotics and artificial intelligence are improving the economy. Since that bubble burst, joblessness has been driven by cyclical forces and austere public policy.","Before Blaming the Robots, Let's Get the Policy Right ",0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,1,0,0,0,2,3.5,4.0,   AI blamed for economic woes       AI blamed for economic woes , improving the economy  economic failures not fault of AI  Improve the economy  improving the economy  improving the economy

Traveling business people could use them to show their faces  by way of a screen on the rolling robot  to colleagues at central headquarters, or to read bedtime stories to their children from afar. That sounds promising. And yet “you have to be slightly wary of what can happen with telepresence machines,” said Noel Sharkey, a professor of artificial intelligence and robotics at the University of Sheffield in England who has written extensively about robots. “If you could use a remote-controlled robot to virtually visit your elderly mother, you could be less likely to get in the car and go over to see her,” Dr. Sharkey said. “Someone who lives five miles away might say: ‘Oh, I can’t be bothered. There’s something good on TV. She’ll be all right. I’ll look at her through the robot.’ ” Still, she said, it۪s an advantage that a real person is in the loop: the visitor who operates the robot, and whose face is seen on the screen. The robot is functioning as a mediator for human interaction, rather than a replacement,۝ she said. To make its brand known in the consumer marketplace, a company called Suitable Technologies is offering its Beam+ telepresence machine for what is  at least in the mobile robot world  the bargain-basement price of $995. The machines will be delivered starting this summer. When the sale ends, the cost will be $1,995. While the Beam+ is aimed at consumers, another telepresence robot has been put to work by many hospitals, hospices and other health care institutions, said Ned Semonite, an executive at VGo Communications, maker of the robot. VGo machines have taken up residence at, among other places, Kaiser Permanente health care centers, where a traveling orthopedist might use one to check on a patient after a knee operation. The patient is at Kaiser,۝ Mr. Semonite said, but the doctor can be anywhere.۝ More than 100 VGo۪s are also in use in schools, operated from afar by students who are homebound because of an illness or sports injury, he said. Students can remotely drive the machine to attend classes, interact with classmates afterward and even pay virtual visits to the auditorium or gym. (But the robot can۪t climb stairs.) The machine۪s cost is $5,995, plus a subscription fee of about $100 a month. Telepresence robots are also appearing in offices, said Frank Tobe, a robotics analyst and publisher of The Robot Report. Typically, they are placed at the primary business site, and so long as its floors are reasonably smooth  shag carpets are out  and decent Internet and internal connections are available, executives worldwide can check in from afar, driving the robot around the office, visiting colleagues and going to meetings.

The Future of Humanity Institute at Oxford University has released a report on the technological requirements for uploading a mind to a machine. A Defense Department agency has funded a program, Synapse, that is trying to develop a computer that resembles a brain in form and function. The futurist Ray Kurzweil, now a director of engineering at Google, has even discussed the potential advantages of forming friendships, “Her”-style, with personalized artificial intelligence systems. He and others contend that we are fast approaching the “technological singularity,” a point at which artificial intelligence, or A.I., surpasses human intelligence, with unpredictable consequences for civilization and human nature. Is all of this really possible? Not everyone thinks so. Some people argue that the capacity to be conscious is unique to biological organisms, so that even superintelligent A.I. programs would be devoid of conscious experience. If this view is correct, then a relationship between a human being and a program like Samantha, however intelligent she might be, would be hopelessly one-sided. Moreover, few humans would want to join Samantha, for to upload your brain to a computer would be to forfeit your consciousness. In the face of the problem of other minds, all you can do is note that other people have brains that are structurally similar to your own and conclude that since you yourself are conscious, others are likely to be conscious as well.

A global catastrophe may make the world inhospitable to biological life forms, and uploading may be the only way to preserve the human way of life and thinking, if not actual humans themselves.

It was written by Jack Paglen, who, while researching, probably thumbed through Mary Shelley’s “Frankenstein; or, the Modern Prometheus,” along with some Isaac Asimov and William Gibson. The scientist here is Will Caster (Mr. Depp), whose work in artificial intelligence has landed him on the cover of Wired magazine. (Even in a brave new world, old media remains useful shorthand.) With his wife, Evelyn (Rebecca Hall), a computer scientist, Will has created PINN, one of those supermachines with sleek surfaces, blinking lights and pulsating menace. Like some other notable machine-based intelligences — including the ship’s computer in the original “Star Trek,” CORA in the television series “Battlestar Galactica” and Samantha in Spike Jonze’s recent film “Her” — PINN has a female voice. It may be that the enduringly creepy legacy of HAL 9000, the mutinous computer from “2001: A Space Odyssey,” has made it tougher for male voices to fill in these disembodied characters. Whatever the case, while artificial intelligences with any kind of human voice seem at once familiar and uncanny, further blurring the line between makers and their machines, those with female voices also suggest another creation story, that of Adam (the origin) and Eve (the product). “Transcendence” plays with this idea, and it’s not for nothing that its heroine is named Evelyn.",I Am My Own Monster (Technology Rules!),3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,3.166666666666667,4.666666666666666,     ,

Already, we have robots to assist in surgery and very basic walking۝ robots that deliver medications and other supplies in hospitals. Robots are increasingly used in rehabilitation after debilitating events like strokes. But a robot that cleans out your arteries or carries linens isn۪t the same as a robot meant to be your friend and caregiver. Even within the medical community, this idea that machines could help fulfill more than just physical needs meets largely with skepticism, and occasionally with outrage. One proof of the social and emotional potential of robot caregivers is probably right in front of you. If you have walked down any street recently, or sat in a restaurant, or entered a workplace, you۪ve probably seen numerous people oblivious to the humans with or around them, while fully engaged with the machines in their hands or on their desks. Admittedly, such people are often interacting with other humans via their machines, but the fact remains that the primary interaction is between person and machine, and despite compelling protests that such interactions do not constitute meaningful, empathic relationships, they seem to provide stimulation and satisfaction to millions, if not billions, of us. Maybe you are one of those people, reading this article on a device. And then, because my patient loves to read but her eyesight is failing, the caregiver robot would offer to read to her. Or maybe it would provide her with a large-print electronic display of a book, the lighting just right for her weakened eyes. After a while the robot would say, I wonder whether we should take a break from reading now and get you dressed. Your daughter۪s coming to visit today.۝ Are there ethical issues we will need to address? Of course.

Most agreed that robotics and artificial intelligence would transform daily life by 2025, but respondents were almost evenly split about what that might mean for the economy and employment. “Advances in A.I. [artificial intelligence] and robotics allow people to cognitively offload repetitive tasks and invest their attention and energy in things where humans can make a difference. We already have cars that talk to us, a phone we can talk to, robots that lift the elderly out of bed and apps that remind us to call Mom. An app can dial Mom’s number and even send flowers, but an app can’t do that most human of all things: emotionally connect with her.” “The degree of integration of A.I. into daily life will depend very much, as it does now, on wealth. The people whose personal digital devices are day-trading for them, and doing the grocery shopping and sending greeting cards on their behalf, are people who are living a different life than those who are worried about missing a day at one of their three jobs due to being sick, and losing the job and being unable to feed their children.” “As an engineering community, we’ve been working on robotics and A.I. for a long time. The rationale behind today’s optimism is that with every technology generation, Moore’s Law brings us closer to having enough computational resources to solve these problems well. But 2025 feels too soon — it takes decades for fundamental ideas like quantum mechanics to be fully worked out by a research community.”",Will You Lose Your Job to a Robot?

For now, most of the mobile robots, sometimes called telepresence robots, are little more than ventriloquists’ dummies with long, invisible strings. But some models have artificial intelligence that lets them do some things on their own, and they will inevitably grow smarter and more agile. They will not only represent the human users, they will augment them.

With a pink lei on one shoulder and a jaunty cap on the other, the robot was surrounded by more than 100 young software engineers, each sitting with a wirelessly connected laptop.

It is not your traditional looking robot  if there is such a thing yet  but looks like an extra-large lollipop on wheels. The robot I adopted, the Texai, is made by Willow Garage, a technology company based in California, and is designed for telepresence. In humanspeak, that means it allows me to take control of the robot remotely and wander around an office, interacting with co-workers and gauging their reactions through the built-in camera and microphone as if I were in the same room. And react they did. While I sat comfortably on my couch at home manipulating the controls in a Web browser, the robot at the office encountered an editor in the hallway who had stepped out for ice cream. She stopped midstride, plastic spoon attached to her mouth as if someone had stuck it there with Super Glue, and she just stared. From the perspective of my computer it looked as if she were frozen in space and time by the sight of a digital version of me. From my computer I could see through two cameras, one pointing directly in front of the robot and one  called the nav-cam  pointing toward the ground and designed to help me avoid obstacles like trash cans or small children. Moments later I came across two other people in another hallway who were clearly engaged in a private conversation. They were unaware that a digital robot with supersonic hearing had sneaked up on them. (The robot۪s motor whirs but is not very loud.) I knew they did not know I could hear them, so I spoke up as I slowly rolled by, sharply interrupting them  the opposite action real people would use as they passed by. These kinds of encounters happened whenever I took the Texai out and about. Some people looked perplexed; it was as if the robot had a special power to pause reality, leaving people temporarily paralyzed, mouth usually agape. Elevators۪ confines are often awkward,  and when we all piled inside to go to the cafeteria, it was even more uncomfortable as people  silently peered out of the corners of their eyes at a man۪s face displayed on a monitor atop a metal stick.

But as Dr. Brooks points out, training a robot to do it is a vastly harder problem for artificial intelligence researchers than I.B.M.’s celebrated victory on “Jeopardy!” this year with a robot named Watson. Yet the challenges remain immense, far higher than artificial intelligence hurdles like speaking and hearing. All these problems where you want to duplicate something biology does, such as perception, touch, planning or grasping, turn out to be hard in fundamental ways,۝ said Gary Bradski, a vision specialist at Willow Garage, a robot development company based here in Silicon Valley. Now the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or Darpa, the Pentagon office that helped jump-start the first generation of artificial intelligence research in the 1960s, is underwriting three competing efforts to develop robotic arms and hands one-tenth as expensive as today’s systems, which often cost $100,000 or more. Others are skeptical, saying that truly useful machines await an artificial intelligence breakthrough that yields vastly more flexible perception. The limits of today۪s most sophisticated robots can be seen in a towel-folding demonstration that a group of students at the University of California, Berkeley, posted on the Internet last year: In spooky, anthropomorphic fashion, a robot deftly folds a series of towels, eyeing the corners, smoothing out wrinkles and neatly stacking them in a pile. In February, for example, Robonaut 2, a dexterous robot developed in a partnership between NASA and General Motors, was carried aboard a space shuttle mission to be installed on the International Space Station. The developers acknowledged that the software required by the system, which is humanoid-shaped from the torso up, was unfinished and that the robot was sent up then only because a rare launching window was available. “Part of what we’re riding on is there has been a very strong push for tactile displays because of smartphones,” said Pablo Garcia, an SRI robot designer who is leading the design of the project, along with Robert Bolles, an artificial intelligence researcher. At Willow Garage, Dr. Bradski and a group of artificial intelligence researchers and roboticists have focused on “hackathons,” in which the company’s PR2 robot has been programmed to do tasks like fetching beer from a refrigerator, playing pool and packing groceries. At the contest, held during a robotics conference in Shanghai, none of the contestants reached the 80 percent goal.

For the artificial intelligence course, students may need some higher math, like linear algebra and probability theory, but there are no restrictions to online participation. So far, the age range is from high school to retirees, and the course has attracted interest from more than 175 countries. The instructors are Sebastian Thrun and Peter Norvig, two of the world’s best-known artificial intelligence experts. In 2005 Dr. Thrun led a team of Stanford students and professors in building a robotic car that won a Pentagon-sponsored challenge by driving 132 miles over unpaved roads in a California desert. More recently he has led a secret Google project to develop autonomous vehicles that have driven more than 100,000 miles on California public roads. Dr. Norvig is a former NASA scientist who is now Google’s director of research and the author of a leading textbook on artificial intelligence. The computer scientists said they were uncertain about why the A.I. class had drawn such a large audience. Dr. Thrun said he had tried to advertise the course this summer by distributing notices at an academic conference in Spain, but had gotten only 80 registrants. Dr. Widom said she had recorded her video lectures during the summer and would use classroom sessions to work with smaller groups of students on projects that might be competitive and to bring in people from the industry to give special lectures. Unlike the A.I. course, this one will compare online students with one another and not with the Stanford students. How will the artificial intelligence instructors grade 58,000 students? The scientists said they would make extensive use of technology. “We have a system running on the Amazon cloud, so we think it will hold up,” Dr. Norvig said.","Virtual and Artificial, but 58,000 Want Course",0,0,0,6,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.380952380952381,4.428571428571429,"                    How will the artificial intelligence instructors grade 58,000 students","                   AI courses offered, interest in learning AI "

The smart machines of the future will need programming, servicing and upgrading — work done, perhaps, by a new class of digital technicians. The intelligent machines, experts add, will be specialists in a field, like the medical assistant project at Microsoft. They must be tailored with specialized software, perhaps igniting a new industry for artificial intelligence applications. Of course, no one really knows just what artificial intelligence will mean for jobs and the economy, but the technology is marching ahead. “Its potential is far greater than simply substituting technology for human labor,” said Erik Brynjolfsson, an economist at the M.I.T Sloan School of Management.

5417d85079881018c3790064,,Science,"For decades, computer scientists have been pursuing artificial intelligence — the use of computers to simulate human thinking. But in recent years, rapid progress has been made in machines that can listen, speak, see, reason and learn, in their way. The prospect, according to scientists and economists, is not only that artificial intelligence will transform the way humans and machines communicate and collaborate, but will also eliminate millions of jobs, create many others and change the nature of work and daily routines. The artificial intelligence technology that has moved furthest into the mainstream is computer understanding of what humans are saying. People increasingly talk to their cellphones to find things, instead of typing. Both Google’s and Microsoft’s search services now respond to voice commands. More drivers are asking their cars to do things like find directions or play music. So the outlook is uncertain for many of the estimated four million workers in American call centers or the nation’s 100,000 medical transcriptionists, whose jobs were already threatened by outsourcing abroad. “Basic work that can be automated is in the bull’s-eye of both technology and globalization, and the rise of artificial intelligence just magnifies that reality,” said Erik Brynjolfsson, an economist at the Sloan School of Management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Still, Mr. Brynjolfsson says artificial intelligence will also spur innovation and create opportunities, both for individuals and entrepreneurial companies, just as the Internet has led to new businesses like Google and new forms of communication like blogs and social networking. Smart machines, experts predict, will someday  tutor students, assist surgeons and safely drive cars. Computers with artificial intelligence can be thought of as the machine equivalent of idiot savants. They can be extremely good at skills that challenge the smartest humans, playing chess like a grandmaster or answering “Jeopardy!” questions like a champion. Yet those skills are in narrow domains of knowledge. What is far harder  for a computer is common-sense skills like understanding the context of language and social situations when talking — taking turns in conversation, for example. The Microsoft projects are only research initiatives, but they suggest where things are headed. And as speech recognition and other artificial intelligence technologies take on more tasks, there are concerns about the social impact of the technology and too little attention paid to its limitations. “It’s a bit like the task faced by a waiter for whom English is a second language in a noisy restaurant,” said Tom Gruber, an artificial intelligence researcher and co-founder of Siri. “It isn’t perfect, but in context the waiter can usually figure out what you want.” The real issue with artificial intelligence, as with any technology, is how it will be used. Automation is a remarkable tool of efficiency and convenience. Using an A.T.M. to make cash deposits and withdrawals beats standing in line to wait for a teller. If an automated voice system in a call center can answer a question, the machine is a better solution than lingering on hold for a customer service agent. Indeed, the increasing usefulness of artificial intelligence — answering questions, completing simple tasks and assisting professionals — means the technology will spread, despite the risks. It will be up to people to guide how it is used. “It’s not human intelligence, but it’s getting to be very good machine intelligence,” said Andries van Dam, a professor of computer science at Brown University. “There are going to be all sorts of errors and problems, and you need human checks and balances, but having artificial intelligence is way better than not having it.”","Computers Learn to Listen, and Some Talk Back",0,0,2,2,0,3,0,4,6,0,0,0,0,2,0,4,3.4666666666666663,4.766666666666667,"            inherent limitations of AI AI may be incapable of common sense  inherent limitations of AI, social impact The social impact of technology and AI is underresearched             "," machines that can listen, speak, see, reason and learn  understanding what humans are saying  AI enhances devices    The AI industry will create jobs and lead innovation  spur economic growth          more efficient use  AI enhances customer service answering questions, completing simple tasks, assisting professionals     "

This basic finding, to be published later this year, is one of dozens from a field called affective computing that is helping scientists discover exactly which features of a robot make it most convincingly real۝ as a social partner, a helper, a teacher. The timing of a robot۪s responses is one. The San Diego researchers found that if RUBI reacted to a child۪s expression or comment too fast, it threw off the interaction; the same happened if the response was too slow. But if the robot reacted within about a second and a half, child and machine were smoothly in sync. The fact is that children۪s reactions to a robot may vary widely, by age and by individual,۝ said Sandra Okita, a Columbia University researcher and co-author of the study. In San Diego, researchers are trying to develop a human-looking robot with sensors that approximate the complexity of a year-old infant’s abilities to feel, see and hear. Babies learn, seemingly effortlessly, by experimenting, by mimicking, by moving their limbs. Could a machine with sufficient artificial intelligence do the same? And what kind of learning systems would be sufficient? The researchers are shooting for nothing less than capturing the foundation of human learning — or, at least, its artificial intelligence equivalent. If robots can learn to learn, on their own and without instruction, they can in principle make the kind of teachers that are responsive to the needs of a class, even an individual child.","Students, Meet Your New Teacher, Mr. Robot",1,1,0,12,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,3.5666666666666664,4.466666666666667,             kids destroy robots                , companionship            kids enthralled with robots

This constant stream of stories suggests that machines are becoming smart and autonomous, a new form of life, and that we should think of them as fellow creatures instead of as tools. But such conclusions aren’t just changing how we think about computers — they are reshaping the basic assumptions of our lives in misguided and ultimately damaging ways. In fact, the nuts and bolts of A.I. research can often be more usefully interpreted without the concept of A.I. at all. For example, I.B.M. scientists recently unveiled a “question answering” machine that is designed to play the TV quiz show “Jeopardy.” Suppose I.B.M. had dispensed with the theatrics, declared it had done Google one better and come up with a new phrase-based search engine. This framing of exactly the same technology would have gained I.B.M.’s team as much (deserved) recognition as the claim of an artificial intelligence, but would also have educated the public about how such a technology might actually be used most effectively. Another example is the way in which robot teachers are portrayed. For starters, these robots aren’t all that sophisticated — miniature robotic devices used in endoscopic surgeries are infinitely more advanced, but they don’t get the same attention because they aren’t presented with the A.I. spin. What bothers me most about this trend, however, is that by allowing artificial intelligence to reshape our concept of personhood, we are leaving ourselves open to the flipside: we think of people more and more as computers, just as we think of computers as people. What all this comes down to is that the very idea of artificial intelligence gives us the cover to avoid accountability by pretending that machines can take on more and more human responsibility. This holds for things that we don’t even think of as artificial intelligence, like the recommendations made by Netflix and Pandora. Seeing movies and listening to music suggested to us by algorithms is relatively harmless, I suppose. But I hope that once in a while the users of those services resist the recommendations; our exposure to art shouldn’t be hemmed in by an algorithm that we merely want to believe predicts our tastes accurately. These algorithms do not represent emotion or meaning, only statistics and correlations. What makes this doubly confounding is that while Silicon Valley might sell artificial intelligence to consumers, our industry certainly wouldn’t apply the same automated techniques to some of its own work.

5424a1a579881017ba4e87c6,,Science,"In 1952 he met Marvin Minsky, a cognitive scientist who was also exploring the idea of machine learning, and John McCarthy, a young mathematician. And within four years, they and seven other scientists, as part of the original Dartmouth Summer Research Project,  had founded a new field and given it a name: artificial intelligence. The conference proved to be a watershed both for the field of artificial intelligence (Dr. McCarthy, a Dartmouth College mathematician at the time, coined the term) and for modern computing. It laid out a proposal for a program of study, stating, “The study is to proceed on the basis of the conjecture that every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can in principle be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it.” The next summer Allen Newell, J.C. Shaw and Herbert Simon, researchers at the Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon University), devised a program to discover proofs of logical theorems. Simulated by hand in 1955, the program, called “Logic Theorist,” was demonstrated at the Dartmouth conference and is considered to be the first effort to create an artificial intelligence program. Mr. Solomonoff went on to pioneer the application of probability theory to solving artificial intelligence problems. But in the 1960s and 1970s he was ahead of his time, and the approach initially had little impact on the field. More recently, probability theory has caught on among artificial intelligence researchers and is now the dominant approach. Mr. Solomonoff later turned his attention to the consequences of artificial intelligence. In 1985 he wrote a paper that speculated on the cost and the time it would take to develop a machine with many times the intelligence of a group of humans. He called this the “infinity point.”","Ray Solomonoff, Pioneer in Artificial Intelligence, Dies at 83",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,3.6666666666666665,4.6,              ,

But the study included conventional laparoscopy   patients among the ones who had robot-assisted surgery, making it difficult to assess its conclusions. Medical researchers say the robot situation is emblematic of a more general issue. New technology has sometimes led to big advances, which can justify extra costs. But often, technology spreads long before investigators know whether it is worthwhile. Dr. Michael J. Barry, a professor of medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, said that once a hospital invests in a robot  $1.39 million for the machine and $140,000 a year for the service contract, according to Intuitive  it has an incentive to use it. Doctors and patients become passionate advocates, assuming that newer means better. The robot۪s ability to reach into small spaces comes with tradeoffs. Ordinarily, doctors can feel how forcefully they are grabbing tissue, how well they are cutting, how their stitches are holding. With the robot, that is lost. And the robot is slow; it typically takes three and a half hours for a prostate operation, according to Intuitive, twice as long as traditional surgery. The study was not ideal  patients were not randomly assigned to have one type of surgery or another, and laparoscopic operations done without a robot were included with the robot-assisted ones because Medicare did not distinguish between the two. But it is the only large national study that compares what is thought to be a largely robot-assisted surgery group with a group that did not have a robot.","Results Unproven, Robotic Surgery Wins Converts",0,0,0,0,0,12,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.733333333333333,4.466666666666667,              ,

Kelly argues that the age of artificial intelligence is finally at hand. This artificial intelligence breakthrough, he argues, is being driven by cheap parallel computation technologies, big data collection and better algorithms. The upshot is clear, “The business plans of the next 10,000 start-ups are easy to forecast: Take X and add A.I.” Advances in artificial intelligence will accelerate this centralizing trend. That’s because A.I. companies will be able to reap the rewards of network effects. The bigger their network and the more data they collect, the more effective and attractive they become. As Kelly puts it, “Once a company enters this virtuous cycle, it tends to grow so big, so fast, that it overwhelms any upstart competitors. As a result, our A.I. future is likely to be ruled by an oligarchy of two or three large, general-purpose cloud-based commercial intelligences.” The second implication is philosophical. A.I. will redefine what it means to be human. Our identity as humans is shaped by what machines and other animals can’t do. For the last few centuries, reason was seen as the ultimate human faculty. But now machines are better at many of the tasks we associate with thinking — like playing chess, winning at Jeopardy, and doing math.

Predator drones, which, though still controlled remotely by humans, come close to a machine that can kill autonomously. Impressed and alarmed by advances in artificial intelligence, a group of computer scientists is debating whether there should be limits on research that might lead to loss of human control over computer-based systems that carry a growing share of society’s workload, from waging war to chatting with customers on the phone. The researchers — leading computer scientists, artificial intelligence researchers and roboticists who met at the Asilomar Conference Grounds on Monterey Bay in California — generally discounted the possibility of highly centralized superintelligences and the idea that intelligence might spring spontaneously from the Internet. But they agreed that robots that can kill autonomously are either already here or will be soon. They focused particular attention on the specter that criminals could exploit artificial intelligence systems as soon as they were developed. What could a criminal do with a speech synthesis system that could masquerade as a human being? What happens if artificial intelligence technology is used to mine personal information from smart phones? The meeting on the future of artificial intelligence was organized by Eric Horvitz, a Microsoft researcher who is now president of the association. Dr. Horvitz said he believed computer scientists must respond to the notions of superintelligent machines and artificial intelligence systems run amok. The meeting on artificial intelligence could be pivotal to the future of the field. Paul Berg, who was the organizer of the 1975 Asilomar meeting and received a Nobel Prize for chemistry in 1980, said it was important for scientific communities to engage the public before alarm and opposition becomes unshakable. Tom Mitchell, a professor of artificial intelligence and machine learning at Carnegie Mellon University, said the February meeting had changed his thinking. “I went in very optimistic about the future of A.I. and thinking that Bill Joy and Ray Kurzweil were far off in their predictions,” he said. But, he added, “The meeting made me want to be more outspoken about these issues and in particular be outspoken about the vast amounts of data collected about our personal lives.” Despite his concerns, Dr. Horvitz said he was hopeful that artificial intelligence research would benefit humans, and perhaps even compensate for human failings. He recently demonstrated a voice-based system that he designed to ask patients about their symptoms and to respond with empathy.

By the mid-1980s, many scientists both inside and outside of the artificial intelligence community had come to see the effort as a failure. The outlook was more promising in 1963 when Dr. McCarthy began his effort. His initial proposal, to the Advanced Research Projects Agency of the Pentagon, envisioned that building a thinking machine would take about a decade. Four and a half decades later, much of the original optimism is back, driven by rapid progress in artificial intelligence technologies, and that sense was tangible last month when more than 200 of the original SAIL scientists assembled at the William Gates Computer Science Building here for a two-day reunion. The graduate students soon discovered the building’s attic and took up residence there. Mr. Earnest found a clever way, known in the parlance of the A.I. community as a “hack,” to pay for a sauna in the basement of the building, and because many of the young researchers were devotees of Tolkien’s “Lord of the Rings,” they created a special font in Elvish and used it to identify offices as places from Middle Earth. Dr. McCarthy coined the term artificial intelligence in the 1950s. Before coming to SAIL he developed the LISP programming language and invented the time-sharing approach to computers. Mr. Earnest designed the first spell-checker and is rightly described as the father of social networking and blogging for his contribution of the finger command that made it possible to tell where the laboratory’s computer users were and what they were doing. Don Knuth wrote the definitive texts on computer programming. Joel Pitts, a Stanford undergraduate, took a version of the Space War computer game and turned it into the first coin-operated video game — which was installed in the university’s student coffee house — months before Nolan Bushnell did the same with Atari. The Nobel Prize-winning geneticist Joshua Lederberg worked with Edward Feigenbaum, a computer scientist,  on an early effort to apply artificial intelligence techniques to create software to act as a kind of medical expert. The laboratory merged with the computer science department at Stanford in 1980, reopened in 2004, and is now enjoying a renaissance. Its trajectory can be seen in the progress made since 1970, when a graduate researcher programmed a robot to automatically follow a white line under controlled lighting conditions at eight-tenths mile per hour. Thirty-five years later, a team of artificial intelligence researchers at Stanford would equip a Volkswagen Touareg named Stanley with lasers, cameras and a cluster of powerful computers to drive autonomously for 131 miles over mountain roads in California at an average speed of 19.1 miles per hour to win $2 million in the 2005 Darpa Grand Challenge, a robotic vehicle contest. But an artificial intelligence? It is still an open question. In 1978, Dr. McCarthy wrote, “human-level A.I. might require 1.7 Einsteins, 2 Maxwells, 5 Faradays and .3 Manhattan Projects.”",Optimism as Artificial Intelligence Pioneers Reunite,0,0,0,0,2,2,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,3.3809523809523805,4.476190476190476,                    ,                renaissance in AI Large amount of research going into it.

But I’ll tell you what scares me most: artificial intelligence. Before we get into what could possibly go wrong, let me first explain what artificial intelligence is. Actually, skip that. I’ll let someone else explain it: Grab an iPhone and ask Siri about the weather or stocks. Or tell her “I’m drunk.” Her answers are artificially intelligent. I’m not alone in my fear. Silicon Valley’s resident futurist, Elon Musk, recently said artificial intelligence is “potentially more dangerous than nukes.” And Stephen Hawking, one of the smartest people on earth, wrote that successful A. I. “would be the biggest event in human history. Unfortunately, it might also be the last.” There is a long list of computer experts and science fiction writers also fearful of a rogue robot-infested future. Two main problems with artificial intelligence lead people like Mr. Musk and Mr. Hawking to worry. The first, more near-future fear, is that we are starting to create machines that can make decisions like humans, but these machines don’t have morality and likely never will. Bonnie Docherty, a lecturer on law at Harvard University and a senior researcher at Human Rights Watch, said that the race to build autonomous weapons with artificial intelligence — which is already underway — is reminiscent of the early days of the race to build nuclear weapons, and that treaties should be put in place now before we get to a point where machines are killing people on the battlefield. But we can hinder some of the potential chaos by following the lead of Google. Earlier this year when the search-engine giant acquired DeepMind, a neuroscience-inspired, artificial intelligence company based in London, the two companies put together an artificial intelligence safety and ethics board that aims to ensure these technologies are developed safely. Demis Hassabis, founder and chief executive of DeepMind, said in a video interview that anyone building artificial intelligence, including governments and companies, should do the same thing. “They should definitely be thinking about the ethical consequences of what they do,” Dr. Hassabis said. “Way ahead of time.”",Artificial Intelligence as a Threat,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,6,4,0,0,0,2.0952380952380953,4.809523809523809,      more dangerous than nukes potentially more dangerous than nukes more dangerous than nukes    ethics of AI        ,

But now, some scientists say, arms makers have crossed into troubling territory: They are developing weapons that rely on artificial intelligence, not human instruction, to decide what to target and whom to kill. Britain, Israel and Norway are already deploying missiles and drones that carry out attacks against enemy radar, tanks or ships without direct human control. After launch, so-called autonomous weapons rely on artificial intelligence and sensors to select targets and to initiate an attack. Armaments with even more advanced self-governance are on the drawing board, although the details usually are kept secret. “An autonomous weapons arms race is already taking place,” said Steve Omohundro, a physicist and artificial intelligence specialist at Self-Aware Systems, a research center in Palo Alto, Calif. “They can respond faster, more efficiently and less predictably.” In recent years, artificial intelligence has begun to supplant human decision-making in a variety of fields, such as high-speed stock trading and medical diagnostics, and even in self-driving cars. But technological advances in three particular areas have made self-governing weapons a real possibility. New types of radar, laser and infrared sensors are helping missiles and drones better calculate their position and orientation. “Machine vision,” resembling that of humans, identifies patterns in images and helps weapons distinguish important targets. This nuanced sensory information can be quickly interpreted by sophisticated artificial intelligence systems, enabling a missile or drone to carry out its own analysis in flight. And computer hardware hosting it all has become relatively inexpensive — and expendable. “It will be operating autonomously when it searches for the enemy fleet,” said Mark A. Gubrud, a physicist and a member of the International Committee for Robot Arms Control, and an early critic of so-called smart weapons. “This is pretty sophisticated stuff that I would call artificial intelligence outside human control.”",Fearing Bombs That Can Pick Whom to Kill,0,1,2,0,0,1,0,2,1,4,0,1,14,0,1,2,2.4444444444444446,4.833333333333333,                 ,warfare

546acfe17988106d5f6270ba,2009-05-24 00:00:00 UTC,Week in Review,"Mountain View, Calif. — It’s summertime and the Terminator is back. A sci-fi movie thrill ride, “Terminator Salvation” comes complete with a malevolent artificial intelligence dubbed Skynet, a military R.&D. project that gained self-awareness and concluded that humans were an irritant — perhaps a bit like athlete’s foot — to be dispatched forthwith. Today, artificial intelligence, once the preserve of science fiction writers and eccentric computer prodigies, is back in fashion and getting serious attention from NASA and from Silicon Valley companies like Google as well as a new round of start-ups that are designing everything from next-generation search engines to machines that listen or that are capable of walking around in the world. A.I.’s new respectability is turning the spotlight back on the question of where the technology might be heading and, more ominously, perhaps, whether computer intelligence will surpass our own, and how quickly. Artificial intelligence is already used to automate and replace some human functions with computer-driven machines. These machines can see and hear, respond to questions, learn, draw inferences and solve problems. But for the Singulatarians, A.I. refers to machines that will be both self-aware and superhuman in their intelligence, and capable of designing better computers and robots faster than humans can today. Such a shift, they say, would lead to a vast acceleration in technological improvements of all kinds. Concerned about the same potential outcome, the A.I. researcher Eliezer S. Yudkowsky, an employee of the Singularity Institute, has proposed the idea of “friendly artificial intelligence,” an engineering discipline that would seek to ensure that future machines would remain our servants or equals rather than our masters. Nevertheless, this generation of humans, at least, is perhaps unlikely to need to rush to the barricades. The artificial-intelligence industry has advanced in fits and starts over the past half-century, since the term “artificial intelligence” was coined by the Stanford University computer scientist John McCarthy in 1956. In 1964, when Mr. McCarthy established the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, the researchers informed their Pentagon backers that the construction of an artificially intelligent machine would take about a decade. Two decades later, in 1984, that original optimism hit a rough patch, leading to the collapse of a crop of A.I. start-up companies in Silicon Valley, a time known as “the A.I. winter.”",The Coming Superbrain,2,2,3,1,0,0,3,1,0,5,1,0,1,3,1,1,3.0666666666666664,4.733333333333333,              ,   interest and investment in AI Search Engines     preventing skynet

I became a modern lecturer-entertainer, with bullet points, borscht belt humor and audiovisual razzle-dazzle. Al, like most of my professors at McGill University in the 1970s, sat at a table and rambled off the top of his head. Yet decades later I can remember Al’s musings: circling an idea, linking it with others, trying different vantage points, exploring variations on a theme. It was all a revelation. Psychology at the time, anxious to look like a hard science, was an empiricist dust bowl, where a “theory” was a line drawn through a set of data points. Al was my first professor who probed ideas. How is Chomsky’s deep structure related to Piaget’s schemas and to the ideas of artificial intelligence? When a man pantomimes walking a dog, where is the “dog” in his behavior? Were neural-network models really cutting-edge science or just the old theory of the association of ideas? I never knew that you could analyze ideas in such depth, and thought Al was the smartest person I ever met. But the most important science education is done at the bench. Wanting as much face time as possible, I did research in Al’s lab, which aimed to understand how the brain organizes a jumble of sound into experiences that correspond to the sound makers in the world. Not only was Al studying a tractable instance of the ancient problem of how the mind knows reality, but he also had the coolest toy in the department — a refrigerator-size minicomputer. As we passed the headphones back and forth, tweaking the beeps and boops, I learned how science is really done: create a world that will show that your ideas are right, but only if they are right.

So the robot pilot declines to engage. When the robot finds another target with no risk of civilian casualties, it fires. In another case, attacking an important terrorist leader in a taxi in front of an apartment building, might be regarded as ethical if the target is important and the risk of civilian casualties low.

In the book, he argued that computing served as a conservative force in society by propping up bureaucracies as well as by redefining the world in a reductionist sense, by restricting the potential of human relationships. The book drove a wedge between Mr. Weizenbaum and other members of the artificial intelligence research community.

5480f9127988103739e1745a,2008-05-03 00:00:00 UTC,Technology,"PALO ALTO, Calif. — Like a good gambler, Daphne Koller, a researcher at Stanford whose work has led to advances in artificial intelligence, sees the world as a web of probabilities. A mathematical theoretician, she has made contributions in areas like robotics and biology. Her biggest accomplishment — and at age 39, she is expected to make more — is creating a set of computational tools for artificial intelligence that can be used by scientists and engineers to do things like predict traffic jams, improve machine vision and understand the way cancer spreads. The award to Ms. Koller, with a prize of $150,000, is viewed by scientists and industry executives as validating her research, which has helped transform artificial intelligence from science fiction and speculation into an engineering discipline that is creating an array of intelligent machines and systems. It is not the first such recognition; in 2004, Ms. Koller received a $500,000 MacArthur Fellowship. Ms. Koller is part of a revival of interest in artificial intelligence. After three decades of disappointments, artificial intelligence researchers are making progress. Recent developments made possible spam filters, Microsoft’s new ClearFlow traffic maps and the driverless robotic cars that Stanford teams have built for competitions sponsored by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. Since arriving at Stanford as a professor in 1995, Ms. Koller has led a group of researchers who have reinvented the discipline of artificial intelligence. Pioneered during the 1960s, the field was originally dominated by efforts to build reasoning systems from logic and rules. Judea Pearl, a computer scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles, had a decade earlier advanced statistical techniques that relied on repeated measurements of real-world phenomena. That philosophy has led her to do research in game theory and artificial intelligence, and more recently in molecular biology. “Daphne is one of the most passionate researchers in the A.I. community,” said Eric Horvitz, a Microsoft researcher and president of the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence. “After being immersed for a few years with the computational challenges of decoding regulatory genomics, she confided her excitement to me, saying something like, ‘I think I’ve become a biologist — I mean a real biologist — and it’s fabulous.’ ”",Pursuing the Next Level of Artificial Intelligence,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,4,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,3.6666666666666665,4.666666666666666,                    ,"biographical       AI is mainstream and already here, award to AI researcher   renaissance in AI, spam detection   renaissance in AI       "

Over the next few decades, however, that may well change: We can easily imagine medical diagnosis by online artificial intelligence, greater use of online competitive procurement for health care services, more transparency in pricing and thus more competition, and much cheaper online education for many students, to cite just a few possibilities. In such a world, many wage gains would come from new and cheaper services, rather than from being able to cut a better deal with the boss at work. The future may also extend a growing category of employment, namely workers who team up with smart robots that require human assistance. Perhaps a smart robot will perform some of the current functions of a factory worker, while the human companion will do what the robot cannot, such as deal with a system breakdown or call a supervisor. Such jobs would require versatility and flexible reasoning, a bit like some of the old manufacturing jobs, but not necessarily a lot of high-powered technical training, again because of the greater ease of the human-computer interface. That too could raise the returns to many relatively unskilled workers.",How Technology Could Help Fight Income Inequality,0,1,1,2,0,2,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4.166666666666666,4.833333333333334,     ,AI combats income gap by opening access

He begins with what scientists know about why humans fall in love with other humans. There are 10 factors, he writes, including mystery, reciprocal liking, and readiness to enter a relationship. Why can’t these factors apply to robots, too? Even something as apparently human as “reciprocal liking” can be programmed into a robot’s behavior, and if it acts as if it likes you that’s often all that matters. When it comes to the even creepier prospect of a robot wanting to have sex with you, Levy takes a similar step-by-step approach. First, he explores why people have sex with other people (for pure pleasure,۝ to express emotional closeness,۝ because your partner wants to۝). He then moves on to why we have sex with a range of artificial objects, from plain old white-bread vibrators to elaborate mechanical contraptions with names like the Thrillhammer and the Stallion XL.

548cfa86798810543aba4e42,2007-07-29 00:00:00 UTC,Magazine,"Maybe something was wrong with its camera sensor, Aryananda said. Maybe that was why it kept looking up at the ceiling and complaining. As she fiddled with the computer that runs the robot, I smiled politely  almost as much for the robot۪s sake, I realized, as for the robot maker۪s  and thought: Well, maybe it is the camera sensor, but if this thing wails You are too far away۝ one more time, I۪m going to throttle it. At the Humanoid Robotics Group at M.I.T., a robot۪s humanoid۝ qualities can include fallibility and whininess as much as physical traits like head, arms and torso. This is where our cultural images of robots as superhumans run headlong into the reality of motors, actuators and cold computer code. Today۪s humanoids are not the sophisticated machines we might have expected by now, which just shows how complicated a task it was that scientists embarked on 15 years ago when they began working on a robot that could think. They are not the docile companions of our collective dreams, robots designed to flawlessly serve our dinners, fold our clothes and do the dull or dangerous jobs that we don۪t want to do. Nor are they the villains of our collective nightmares, poised for robotic rebellion against humans whose machine creations have become smarter than the humans themselves. They are, instead, hunks of metal tethered to computers, which need their human designers to get them going and to smooth the hiccups along the way. At the moment, no single robot can do very much. The competencies have been cobbled together: one robot is able to grab a soup can when you tell it to put it on a shelf; another will look you in the eye and make babbling noises in keeping with the inflection of your voice. One robot might be able to learn some new words; another can take the perspective of a human collaborator; still another can recognize itself in a mirror. Taken together, each small accomplishment brings the field closer to a time when a robot with true intelligence  and with perhaps other human qualities, too, like emotions and autonomy  is at least a theoretical possibility. If that possibility comes to pass, what then? Will these new robots be capable of what we recognize as learning? Of what we recognize as consciousness? Will it know that it is a robot and that you are not? We already live with many objects that are, in one sense, robots: the voice in a car۪s Global Positioning System, for instance, which senses shifts in its own location and can change its behavior accordingly. But scientists working in the field mean something else when they talk about sociable robots. To qualify as that kind of robot, they say, a machine must have at least two characteristics. It must be situated, and it must be embodied. Being situated means being able to sense its environment and be responsive to it; being embodied means having a physical body through which to experience the world. A G.P.S. robot is situated but not embodied, while an assembly-line robot that repeats the same action over and over again is embodied but not situated. Sociable robots must be both, as well as exhibiting an understanding of social beings. The push for sociable robots comes from two directions. One is pragmatic: if Bill Gates is right and the robots are coming, they should be designed in a way that makes them fit most naturally into the lives of ordinary people. The other is more theoretical: if a robot can be designed to learn the same way natural creatures do, this could be a significant boost for the field of artificial intelligence. As Brooks sat with me in his office and reflected on his career from the vantage point of a 52-year-old about to return to full-time research — a man going through what he called “a scientific midlife crisis” — a theme emerged. Each time he faced a problem in artificial intelligence, he said, he looked for the implicit assumption that everyone else took for granted, and then he tried to negate it. In the 1980s, the implicit assumption was that abstract reasoning was the highest form of intelligence, the one that programmers should strive to imitate. This led to a focus on symbolic processing, on tough tasks like playing chess or solving problems in algebra or calculus. Tasks that, as Brooks slyly put it in “Flesh and Machines,” “highly educated male scientists found challenging.” But Brooks wanted to build an artificial intelligence system that did the supposedly simple things, not mental acrobatics like chess but things that come naturally to any 4-year-old and that were eluding the symbolic processing capabilities of the computers. These cognitive tasks — visually distinguishing a cup from a chair, walking on two legs, making your way from bedroom to bathroom — were difficult to write into computer code because they did not require an explicit chain of reasoning; they just happened. And the way they happened was grounded in the fact that the 4-year-old had a body and that each action the child took provided more sensory information and, ultimately, more learning. This approach has come to be known as embodied intelligence. In 1993, Brooks started to develop a new robot, a humanoid equipped with artificial intelligence, according to this new logic. His motivation was more theoretical than practical: to offer a new way of thinking about intelligence itself. Most artificial-intelligence programs at the time were designed from the top down, connecting all relevant processes of a robot — raw sensory input, perception, motor activity, behavior — in what was called a cognition box, a sort of centralized zone for all high-level computation. A walking robot, for instance, was programmed to go through an elaborate planning process before it took a step. It had to scan its location, obtain a three-dimensional model of the terrain, plan a path between any obstacles it had detected, plan where to put its right foot along that path, plan the pressures on each joint to get its foot to that spot, plan how to twist the rest of its body to make its right foot move and plan the same set of behaviors for placing its left foot at the next spot along the path, and then finally it would move its feet. Brooks turned the top-down approach on its head; he did away with the cognition box altogether. “No cognition,” he wrote in “Flesh and Machines.” “Just sensing and action.” In effect, he wrote, he was leaving out what was thought to be the “intelligence” part of “artificial intelligence.” The way Brooks’s robot was designed to start walking, he wrote, was “by moving its feet.” In addition, Cog was programmed to learn new things based on its sensory and motor inputs, much as babies learn new things by seeing how their bodies react to and affect their surroundings. Cog۪s arm motors, for instance, were calibrated to respond to the weight of a held object. When a student handed a Slinky to Cog, the oscillators in its elbowlike joints gave feedback about the toy۪s weight and position. After a few hours of practice, the robot could make the Slinky slither by raising and lowering its arms. If it was given a heavier Slinky or a drumstick, it would be able to adjust its motions accordingly. The learning was minimal, but it was a start  and it was, significantly, learning derived from the input of motors, gears and oscillators, the robot equivalent of muscles. Unlike Cog۪s, Kismet۪s learning was more social than cognitive. What made the robot so lifelike was its ability to have what Breazeal called proto-conversations۝ with a variety of human interlocutors. Run by 15 parallel computers operating simultaneously, Kismet was programmed to have the same basic motivations as a 6-month-old child: the drive for novelty, the drive for social interaction and the drive for periodic rest. The behaviors to achieve these goals, like the ability to look for brightly colored objects or to recognize the human face, were also part of Kismet۪s innate program. So were the facial behaviors that reflected Kismet۪s mood states  aroused, bored or neutral  which changed according to whether the robot۪s basic drives were being satisfied. Kismet is now retired and on permanent display, inert as a bronze statue, at the M.I.T. Museum. The most famous robot now in Breazeal’s lab, the one that the graduate students compete for time with, looks nothing like Kismet. It is a three-foot-tall, head-to-toe creature, sort of a badger, sort of a Yoda, with big eyes, enormous pointy ears, a mouth with soft lips and tiny teeth, a furry belly, furry legs and pliable hands with real-looking fingernails. The reason the robot, called Leonardo (Leo for short), is so lifelike is that it was made by Hollywood animatronics experts at the Stan Winston Studio. (Breazeal consulted with the studio on the construction of the robotic teddy bear in the 2001 Steven Spielberg film “A.I.”) As soon as Leo arrived in the lab, Breazeal said, her students started dismantling it, stripping out all the remote-control wiring and configuring it instead with a brain and body that operated not by remote control but by computer-based artificial intelligence. Unfortunately, Leo was turned off the day I arrived, inertly presiding over one corner of the lab like a fuzzy Buddha. Berlin and Gray and their colleague, Andrea Thomaz, a postdoctoral researcher, said that they would be happy to turn on the robot for me but that the process would take time and that I would have to come back the next morning. They also wanted to know what it was in particular that I wanted to see Leo do because, it turned out, the robot could go through its paces only when the right computer program was geared up. This was my first clue that Leo maybe wasn۪t going to turn out to be quite as clever as I had thought. It turned out Leo wasn۪t seeing the young men۪s faces or bodies; it was seeing something else. Gray and Berlin were each wearing a headband and a glove, which I hadn۪t noticed in the video, and the robot۪s optical motion tracking system could see nothing but the unique arrangements of reflective tape on their accessories. What the robot saw were bunches of dots. Dots in one geometric arrangement meant Person A; in a different arrangement, they meant Person B. There was a different arrangement of tape on the two different snacks, too, and also on the two different locks for the boxes. On a big monitor alongside Leo was an image of what was going on inside its brain۝: one set of dots represented Leo۪s brain; another set of dots represented Berlin۪s brain; a third set of dots represented Gray۪s. The robot brain was programmed to keep track of it all. Leo’s behavior might not have been an act of real curiosity or empathy, but it was an impressive feat nonetheless. Still, I felt a little twinge of disappointment, and for that I blame Hollywood. I’ve been exposed to robot hype for years, from the TV of my childhood — Rosie the robot maid on “The Jetsons,” that weird talking garbage-can robot on “Lost in Space” — to the more contemporary robots-gone-wild of films like “Blade Runner” and “I, Robot.” Despite my basic cold, hard rationalism, I was prepared to be bowled over by a robot that was adorable, autonomous and smart. What I saw in Leo was no small accomplishment in terms of artificial intelligence and the modeling of human cognition, but it was just not quite the accomplishment I had been expecting. I had been expecting something closer to “real.” Domo۪s looks are just barely humanoid, but that probably works to its advantage. Scientists believe that the more a robot looks like a person, the more favorably we tend to view it, but only up to a point. After that, our response slips into what the Japanese roboticist Masahiro Mori has called the uncanny valley.۝ We start expecting too much of the robots because they so closely resemble real people, and when they fail to deliver, we recoil in something like disgust. This zombie effect is one aspect of a new discipline that Breazeal is trying to create called human-robot interaction. Last March, Breazeal and Alan Schultz of the Naval Research Laboratory convened the field۪s second annual conference in Arlington, Va., with presentations as diverse as describing how people react to instructions to kill۝ a humanoid robot and a film festival featuring videos of human-robot interaction bloopers. Anyone who tells you that in human-robot interactions the robot is doing anything  well, he is just kidding himself,۝ she told me, grumpy because Mertz was misbehaving. Whatever there is in human-robot interaction is there because the human puts it there.۝ Kidd is recruiting 15 volunteers from around Boston to take Autom into their homes for six weeks. They will be told to interact with the robot at least once a day, recording food intake and exercise on its touch screen. The plan is to compare their experiences with those of two other groups of 15 dieters each. One group will interact with the same weight-loss coaching software through a touch screen only; the other will record daily food intake and exercise the old-fashioned way, with paper and pen. Kidd said that the study is too short-term to use weight loss as a measure of whether the robot is a useful dieting aid. But at this point, his research questions are more subjective anyway: Do participants feel more connected to the robot than they do to the touch screen? And do they think of that robot on the kitchen counter as an ally or a pest? The bare bones of the toddler robots already exist, in the form of a robot designed in Grupen۪s lab called uBot-5. A few of these uBots are now being developed for use in assisted-living centers in research designed to see how the robots interact with the frail elderly. Each uBot-5 is about three feet tall, with a big head, very long arms (long enough to touch the ground, should the arms be needed for balance) and two oversize wheels. It has big eyes, rubber balls at the ends of its arms and a video screen for a face. (Breazeal۪s version will have sleek torsos, expressive faces and realistic hands.) In one slide that Grupen uses in his PowerPoint presentations, the uBot-5 robot is holding a stethoscope to the chest of a woman lying on the ground after a simulated fall. The uBot is designed to connect by video hookup to a health care practitioner, but still, the image of a robot providing even this level of emergency medical care is, to say the least, disconcerting. More disconcerting still is the image of a robot looking at itself in the mirror and waving hello  a robot with a primitive version of self-awareness. A first step in this direction occurred in September 2004 with reports from Yale about Nico, a humanoid robot. Nico, its designers announced, was able to recognize itself in a mirror. One of its creators, Brian Scassellati, earned his doctorate in 2001 at M.I.T., where he worked on Cog and Kismet  to which Nico bears a family resemblance. Nico has visible workings, a head, arms and torso made of steel and a graceful tilt to its shoulders and neck. Like the M.I.T. robots, Nico has no legs, because Scassellati, now an associate professor of computer science at Yale, wanted to concentrate on what it could do with its upper body and, in particular, the cameras in its eyes.",The Real Transformers,11,1,4,0,4,3,1,0,3,0,0,2,0,4,0,0,3.380952380952381,4.380952380952381,                   inherent limitations of AI                        robots disappoint                 robotic self awareness  ,"        What constitutes true AI     sociable robots sociable robots      embodied intelligence                                  Study with volunteers to examine robot that will hopefully help dieters lose weight, robot ally or pest?,  a useful dieting aid companionship    self-awareness "

In 2009, the president of the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence, Eric Horvitz, organized a meeting of computer scientists in California to discuss the possible ramifications of A.I. advances. The group concluded that the advances were largely positive and lauded the “relatively graceful” progress. But now, in the wake of recent technological advances in computer vision, speech recognition and robotics, scientists say they are increasingly concerned that artificial intelligence technologies may permanently displace human workers, roboticize warfare and make of Orwellian surveillance techniques easier to develop, among other disastrous effects. Dr. Horvitz, now the managing director of the Redmond, Wash., campus of Microsoft Research, last year approached John Hennessy, a computer scientist and president of Stanford University, about the idea of a long-term study that would chart the progress of artificial intelligence and its effect on society. Dr. Horvitz and his wife, Mary Horvitz, agreed to fund the initiative, called the “One Hundred Year Study on Artificial Intelligence.” “Loss of control of A.I. systems has become a big concern,” he said. “It scares people.” Rather than simply dismiss these dystopian claims, he said, scientists instead must monitor and continually evaluate the technologies. The committee will choose a panel of specialists who will produce a report on artificial intelligence and its effects that is to be published late in 2015.In a white paper outlining the project, Dr. Horvitz described 18 areas that might be considered, including law, ethics, the economy, war and crime. Future reports will be produced at regular intervals. Dr. Horvitz said that progress in the field of artificial intelligence had consistently been overestimated. Still, Dr. Horvitz acknowledged, the pace of technological change has accelerated, as has the reach of artificial intelligence. He cited Stuxnet, the malicious program developed by intelligence agencies to attack Iranian nuclear facilities, as an example.",Study to Examine Effects of Artificial Intelligence,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,7,0,2,7,1,1,5,2.6296296296296298,4.703703703703704,         AI used for Orwellian surveillance techniques                 ,       advances were largely positive                   
548f5fb5798810619765e34f,2014-12-16 00:00:00 UTC,Science,"Yet for the 30 (soon to be 50) artificial-intelligence researchers who can look out on a striking view of downtown Seattle, the futuristic surroundings offer a paradoxical note: AI2 is an effort to advance artificial intelligence while simultaneously reaching back into the field’s past. While Silicon Valley looks to fashionable techniques like neural networks and machine learning that have rapidly advanced the state of the art, Dr. Etzioni remains a practitioner of a modern version of what used to be known as Gofai, for good old-fashioned artificial intelligence. In recent years, however, A.I. has come roaring back as speech recognition, machine vision and self-driving cars have made progress with powerful computers, cheap sensors and machine-learning techniques. That has started a Silicon Valley gold rush led by Google, Facebook and Apple, drawing outsiders like Alibaba and Baidu in China, all caught up in a frantic race to hire the world’s best machine-learning talent. But the debate over how to reach genuine artificial intelligence has not ended, and Dr. Etzioni and Mr. Allen are betting that their path is more pragmatic. The power of the new techniques is not disputed, but there is a growing debate over whether they can take the field to human-level capabilities by themselves. “Think of it as Sherlock Holmes versus Spider-Man,” said Jerry Kaplan, a visiting lecturer at Stanford who teaches a course on the history and philosophy of artificial intelligence, comparing Holmes’s deductive powers with the irrational “spider sense” that tingles at the base of Spider-Man’s skull and alerts him to danger. Moreover, he says, both he and Mr. Allen believe that technology cannot be separated from its social and economic consequences. They have added a social mission to the project that they call “artificial intelligence for the common good.” The success or failure of the project, however, will ultimately hinge on whether Dr. Etzioni can create a new synthesis of artificial intelligence, weaving together powerful machine-learning tools with traditional logic-oriented software. The current fad for big data, of which machine learning is a major component, has significant limits. “If you step back a little and say we want to do A.I., then you will realize that A.I. needs knowledge, reasoning and explanation,” he said. “My argument is that big data has made great progress in limited areas.” Some technology experts argue that self-aware computing machines are now on the horizon. “As for A.I. progress, we’re mostly haggling about a few decades,” said Hans Moravec, a leading roboticist who is the chief scientist of Seegrid Corporation, a maker of autonomous vehicles for warehouse applications. “I’m content to simply watch it play out, trying to do my part. I do want fully autonomous robots as soon as possible, to begin visiting the rest of the universe.” Whether AI2’s research leads to a new generation of thinking machine or just more incremental advances, the project is a clear indication that artificial intelligence has once again become the defining force in the software world. “The narrative has changed,” said Peter Norvig, Google’s director of research. “It has switched from, ‘Isn’t it terrible that artificial intelligence is a failure?’ to ‘Isn’t it terrible that A.I. is a success?’ ”",Innovators of Intelligence Look to Past,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,3.303030303030303,4.454545454545454,                                ,    optimism about AI progress  AI in communication                       optimism about AI's future

Jeff Bezos, the chief executive of Amazon.com, has created Amazon Mechanical Turk, an online service involving human workers, and he has also personally invested in a human-assisted search company called ChaCha. Mr. Bezos describes the phenomenon very prettily, calling it “artificial artificial intelligence.” “Normally, a human makes a request of a computer, and the computer does the computation of the task,” he said. “But artificial artificial intelligences like Mechanical Turk invert all that. The computer has a task that is easy for a human but extraordinarily hard for the computer. So instead of calling a computer service to perform the function, it calls a human.” Mechanical Turk’s customers are corporations. By contrast, ChaCha.com, a start-up in Carmel, Ind., uses artificial artificial intelligence — sometimes also called crowdsourcing — to help individual computer users find better results when they search the Web. ChaCha, which began last year, pays 30,000 flesh-and-blood “guides” working from home or the local coffee shop as much as $10 an hour to direct Web surfers to the most relevant resources. THERE have been two common objections to artificial artificial intelligence. The first, confirmed by my own experiences searching on ChaCha, is that the networks are no more intelligent than their smartest members. Katharine Mieszkowski, writing last year on Salon.com, raised the second, more serious criticism. She saw Mechanical Turk as a kind of virtual sweatshop. “There is something a little disturbing about a billionaire like Bezos dreaming up new ways to get ordinary folk to do work for him for pennies,” she wrote. We probably have at least another 25 years before computers are more powerful than human brains, according to the most optimistic artificial intelligence experts. Until then, people will be able to sell their idle brains to the companies and people who need the special processing power that they alone possess through marketplaces like Mechanical Turk and ChaCha.","Artificial Intelligence, With Help From the Humans",0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,3,2.8666666666666667,3.733333333333333," Services such as this one, Amazon Mechanical Turk, are assisting computers learn jobs that AI will later take    inherent limitations of AI      inherent limitations of AI, AI promotes sweatshop   ","   Mechanical Turk  AI needs people so people aren't disposable  AI and crowdsourcing work together, AI provides jobs to crowdsourcers       "

A half-century after the term was coined, both scientists and engineers say they are making rapid progress in simulating the human brain, and their work is finding its way into a new wave of real-world products. Though most of the truly futuristic projects are probably years from the commercial market, scientists say that after a lull, artificial intelligence has rapidly grown far more sophisticated. Today some scientists are beginning to use the term cognitive computing, to distinguish their research from an earlier generation of artificial intelligence work. What sets the new researchers apart is a wealth of new biological data on how the human brain functions. Last October, a robot car designed by a team of Stanford engineers covered 132 miles of desert road without human intervention to capture a $2 million prize offered by the  Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, part of the Pentagon. The feat was particularly striking because 18 months earlier, during the first such competition, the best vehicle got no farther than seven miles, becoming stuck after driving off a mountain road. Although some people are skeptical that Mr. Hecht-Nielsen can achieve what he describes, he does have one successful artificial intelligence business under his belt. In 1986, he founded HNC Software, which sold systems to detect credit card fraud using neural network technology designed to mimic biological circuits in the brain. HNC was sold in 2002 to the Fair Isaac Corporation, where Mr. Hecht-Nielsen is a vice president and leads a small research group. During the 1960’s and 1970’s, the original artificial intelligence researchers began designing computer software programs they called “expert systems,” which were essentially databases accompanied by a set of logical rules. They were handicapped both by underpowered computers and by the absence of the wealth of data that today’s researchers have amassed about the actual structure and function of the biological brain. Those shortcomings led to the failure of a first generation of artificial intelligence companies in the 1980’s, which became known as the A.I. Winter. Recently, however, researchers have begun to speak of an A.I. Spring emerging as scientists develop theories on the workings of the human mind. They are being aided by the exponential increase in processing power, which has created computers with millions of times the power of those available to researchers in the 1960’s — at consumer prices. At the moment, the Stanford team is working on the first steps necessary to make the robot they are building function well in an American household. The team is focusing on systems that will consistently recognize standard doorknobs and is building robot hands to open doors. “It’s time to build an A.I. robot,” said Andrew Ng, a Stanford computer scientist and a leader of the project, called Stanford Artificial Intelligence Robot, or Stair. “The dream is to put a robot in every home.”",Brainy Robots Start Stepping Into Daily Life,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,3.583333333333333,4.5,            handicapped both by underpowered computers and by the absence of the wealth of data           ," field is progressing, finally having real-world applications better commercial product        credit card fraud detection     prices AI Spring or renaissance in AI    interest and investment in AI  “The dream is to put a robot in every home.” "

54ae8ed77988105cf6096236,,Magazine,"Last spring, eight years after he and his students packed a computer workstation into a piece of luggage and headed to Heidelberg, Seung published a paper in the prestigious journal Nature, demonstrating how the brain’s neural connections can be mapped — and discoveries made — using an ingenious mix of artificial intelligence and a competitive online game. Seung has also become the leading proponent of a plan, which he described in a 2012 book, to create a wiring diagram of all 100 trillion connections between the neurons of the human brain, an unimaginably vast and complex network known as the connectome. In 2012, Seung started EyeWire, an online game that challenges the public to trace neuronal wiring — now using computers, not pens — in the retina of a mouse’s eye. Seung’s artificial-­intelligence algorithms process the raw images, then players earn points as they mark, paint-by-numbers style, the branches of a neuron through a three-dimensional cube. The game has attracted 165,000 players in 164 countries. In effect, Seung is employing artificial intelligence as a force multiplier for a global, all-volunteer army that has included Lorinda, a Missouri grandmother who also paints watercolors, and Iliyan (a.k.a. @crazyman4865), a high-school student in Bulgaria who once played for nearly 24 hours straight. Computers do what they can and then leave the rest to what remains the most potent pattern-recognition technology ever discovered: the human brain. Ultimately, Seung still hopes that artificial intelligence will be able to handle the entire job. But in the meantime, he is working to recruit more help. In August, South Korea’s largest telecom company announced a partnership with EyeWire, running nationwide ads to bring in more players. In the next few years, Seung hopes to go bigger by enticing a company to turn EyeWire into a game with characters and a story line that people play purely for fun. “Think of what we could do,” Seung said, “if we could capture even a small fraction of the mental effort that goes into Angry Birds.” As connectomics has gained traction, though, there are the first hints that it may be of interest to more than just monkish academics. In September, at a Brain Initiative conference in the Eisenhower building on the White House grounds, it was announced that Google had started its own connectome project. Tom Dean, a Google research scientist and the former chairman of the Brown University computer-science department, told me he has been assembling a team to improve the artificial intelligence: four engineers in Mountain View, Calif., and a group based in Seattle. To begin, Dean said, Google will be working most closely with the Allen Institute, which is trying to understand how the brain of a mouse processes images from the eye. Yet Dean said they also want to serve as a clearinghouse for Seung and others, applying different variations of artificial intelligence to brain imagery coming out of different labs, to see what works best. Eventually, Dean said, he hopes for a Google Earth of the brain, weaving together many different kinds of maps, across many scales, allowing scientists to behold an entire brain and then zoom in to see the firing of a single neuron, “like lightning in a thunderstorm.” It’s possible now to see a virtuous cycle that could build the connectome. The artificial intelligence used at Google, and in EyeWire, is known as deep learning because it takes its central principles from the way networks of neurons function. Over the last few years, deep learning has become a precious commercial tool, bringing unexpected leaps in image and voice recognition, and now it is being deployed to map the brain. This could, in the coming decades, lead to more insights about neural networks, improving deep learning itself — the premise of a new project funded by Iarpa, a blue-sky research arm of the American intelligence community, and perhaps one reason for Google’s interest. Better deep learning, in turn, could be used to accelerate the mapping and understanding of the brain, and so on.",Sebastian Seung’s Quest to Map the Human Brain,0,0,0,0,2,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4.2666666666666675,4.666666666666666,              ," create a wiring diagram of all 100 trillion connections between the neurons of the human brain           AI helps us map the human brain accelerate the mapping and understanding of the brain AI enhances understanding of brain, AI is progressing"

My main goal is to reduce the number of noncombatant casualties in warfare,۝ he says. His lab developed what he calls an ethical adapter۝ that helps the robot emulate guilt. It۪s set in motion when the program detects a difference between how much destruction is expected when using a particular weapon and how much actually occurs. If the difference is too great, the robot۪s guilt level reaches a certain threshold, and it stops using the weapon. Arkin says robots sometimes won۪t be able to parse more complicated situations in which the right answer isn۪t a simple shoot/don۪t shoot decision. But on balance, he says, they will make fewer mistakes than humans, whose battlefield behavior is often clouded by panic, confusion or fear. A robot۪s lack of emotion is precisely what makes many people uncomfortable with the idea of trying to give it human characteristics. Death by robot is an undignified death, Peter Asaro, an affiliate scholar at the Center for Internet and Society at Stanford Law School, said in a speech in May at a United Nations conference on conventional weapons in Geneva.

And if they۪re not capable of that and we allow them to kill people under the law, then we all lose dignity, in the way that if we permit slavery, it۪s not just the suffering of those who are slaves but all of humanity that suffers the indignity that there are any slaves at all.۝ The U.N. will take up questions about the uses of autonomous weapons again in April.

The robot could catch a couple lazy fly balls, but it moved only three feet per second and was too slow to stop any hot shots. Now, Sugar has helped build a robot that is more suited to the speed of today's game, with two motors, a suspension system, four-wheel steering and four-wheel-drive transmission. This robot is smaller than its predecessor, but can move about 30 feet per second and has an estimated .750 fielding percentage. Because the robot cannot carry a mitt, it steadies the ball with a foam bumper in front of its body. Sugar and McBeath are hoping eventually to affix a basket to the robot so it will be able to camp out under fly balls. They envision someday having baseball skills competitions with different robots around the world.

After reading Nick Bostrom’s book “Superintelligence,” Musk even wondered aloud if A.I. may be “our biggest existential threat.” Positions on A.I. are split, and not just on its dangers. Some insist that “hard A.I.” (with human-level intelligence) can never exist, while others conclude that it is inevitable. But in many cases these debates may be missing the real point of what it means to live and think with forms of synthetic intelligence very different from our own. That point, in short, is that a mature A.I. is not necessarily a humanlike intelligence, or one that is at our disposal. If we look for A.I. in the wrong ways, it may emerge in forms that are needlessly difficult to recognize, amplifying its risks and retarding its benefits. This is not just a concern for the future. A.I. is already out of the lab and deep into the fabric of things. “Soft A.I.,” such as Apple’s Siri and Amazon recommendation engines, along with infrastructural A.I., such as high-speed algorithmic trading, smart vehicles and industrial robotics, are increasingly a part of everyday life — part of how our tools work, how our cities move and how our economy builds and trades things. Unfortunately, the popular conception of A.I., at least as depicted in countless movies, games and books, still seems to assume that humanlike characteristics (anger, jealousy, confusion, avarice, pride, desire, not to mention cold alienation) are the most important ones to be on the lookout for. This anthropocentric fallacy may contradict the implications of contemporary A.I. research, but it is still a prism through which much of our culture views an encounter with advanced synthetic cognition. Unless we assume that humanlike intelligence represents all possible forms of intelligence – a whopper of an assumption – why define an advanced A.I. by its resemblance to ours? After all, “intelligence” is notoriously difficult to define, and human intelligence simply can’t exhaust the possibilities. Granted, doing so may at times have practical value in the laboratory, but in cultural terms it is self-defeating, unethical and perhaps even dangerous. We need a popular culture of A.I. that is less parochial and narcissistic, one that is based on more than simply looking for a machine version of our own reflection. As a basis for staging encounters between various A.I.s and humans, that would be a deeply flawed precondition for communication. Needless to say, our historical track record with “first contacts,” even among ourselves, does not provide clear comfort that we are well-prepared. The idea of measuring A.I. by its ability to “pass” as a human – dramatized in countless sci-fi films, from Ridley Scott’s “Blade Runner” to Spike Jonze’s “Her” – is actually as old as modern A.I. research itself. It is traceable at least to 1950 when the British mathematician Alan Turing published “Computing Machinery and Intelligence,” a paper in which he described what we now call the “Turing Test,” and which he referred to as the “imitation game.” There are different versions of the test, all of which are revealing as to why our approach to the culture and ethics of A.I. is what it is, for good and bad. For the most familiar version, a human interrogator asks questions of two hidden contestants, one a human and the other a computer. Turing suggests that if the interrogator usually cannot tell which is which, and if the computer can successfully pass as human, then can we not conclude, for practical purposes, that the computer is “intelligent”? One notes the sour ironic correspondence between asking an A.I. to “pass” the test in order to qualify as intelligent — to “pass” as a human intelligence — with Turing’s own need to hide his homosexuality and to “pass” as a straight man. The demands of both bluffs are unnecessary and profoundly unfair. Passing as a person, as a white or black person, or as a man or woman, for example, comes down to what others see and interpret. Because everyone else is already willing to read others according to conventional cues (of race, sex, gender, species, etc.) the complicity between whoever (or whatever) is passing and those among which he or she or it performs is what allows passing to succeed. Whether or not an A.I. is trying to pass as a human or is merely in drag as a human is another matter. Is the ruse all just a game or, as for some people who are compelled to pass in their daily lives, an essential camouflage? Either way, “passing” may say more about the audience than about the performers. We would do better to presume that in our universe, “thinking” is much more diverse, even alien, than our own particular case. The real philosophical lessons of A.I. will have less to do with humans teaching machines how to think than with machines teaching humans a fuller and truer range of what thinking can be (and for that matter, what being human can be). That we would wish to define the very existence of A.I. in relation to its ability to mimic how humans think that humans think will be looked back upon as a weird sort of speciesism. The legacy of that conceit helped to steer some older A.I. research down disappointingly fruitless paths, hoping to recreate human minds from available parts. It just doesn’t work that way. Contemporary A.I. research suggests instead that the threshold by which any particular arrangement of matter can be said to be “intelligent” doesn’t have much to do with how it reflects humanness back at us. As Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig (now director of research at Google) suggest in their essential A.I. textbook, biomorphic imitation is not how we design complex technology. Airplanes don’t fly like birds fly, and we certainly don’t try to trick birds into thinking that airplanes are birds in order to test whether those planes “really” are flying machines. Why do it for A.I. then? Today’s serious A.I. research does not focus on the Turing Test as an objective criterion of success, and yet in our popular culture of A.I., the test’s anthropocentrism holds such durable conceptual importance. Like the animals who talk like teenagers in a Disney movie, other minds are conceivable mostly by way of puerile ventriloquism. Where is the real injury in this? If we want everyday A.I. to be congenial in a humane sort of way, so what? The answer is that we have much to gain from a more sincere and disenchanted relationship to synthetic intelligences, and much to lose by keeping illusions on life support. Some philosophers write about the possible ethical “rights” of A.I. as sentient entities, but that’s not my point here. Rather, the truer perspective is also the better one for us as thinking technical creatures. Musk, Gates and Hawking made headlines by speaking to the dangers that A.I. may pose. Their points are important, but I fear were largely misunderstood by many readers. Relying on efforts to program A.I. not to “harm humans” (inspired by on Isaac Asimov’s “three laws” of robotics from 1942) makes sense only when an A.I. knows what humans are and what harming them might mean. There are many ways that an A.I. might harm us that that have nothing to do with its malevolence toward us, and chief among these is exactly following our well-meaning instructions to an idiotic and catastrophic extreme. Instead of mechanical failure or a transgression of moral code, the A.I. may pose an existential risk because it is both powerfully intelligent and disinterested in humans. To the extent that we recognize A.I. by its anthropomorphic qualities, or presume its preoccupation with us, we are vulnerable to those eventualities. Whether or not “hard A.I.” ever appears, the harm is also in the loss of all that we prevent ourselves from discovering and understanding when we insist on protecting beliefs we know to be false. In the 1950 essay, Turing offers several rebuttals to his speculative A.I., including a striking comparison with earlier objections to Copernican astronomy. Copernican traumas that abolish the false centrality and absolute specialness of human thought and species-being are priceless accomplishments. They allow for human culture based on how the world actually is more than on how it appears to us from our limited vantage point. Turing referred to these as “theological objections,” but one could argue that the anthropomorphic precondition for A.I. is a “pre-Copernican” attitude as well, however secular it may appear. The advent of robust inhuman A.I. may let us achieve another disenchantment, one that should enable a more reality-based understanding of ourselves, our situation, and a fuller and more complex understanding of what “intelligence” is and is not. From there we can hopefully make our world with a greater confidence that our models are good approximations of what’s out there (always a helpful thing.) One wonders whether it is only from a society that once gave theological and legislative comfort to chattel slavery that this particular affirmation could still be offered in 2015 with such satisfied naïveté? This is the sentiment — this philosophy of technology exactly — that is the basic algorithm of the Anthropocenic predicament, and consenting to it would also foreclose adequate encounters with A.I. It is time to move on. This pretentious folklore is too expensive. Cognoscenti including Stephen Hawking, Elon Musk and Bill Gates, among others, have recently weighed in on its potential and perils.

The advent of robust inhuman A.I. may let us achieve another disenchantment, one that should enable a more reality-based understanding of ourselves, our situation, and a fuller and more complex understanding of what “intelligence” is and is not. From there we can hopefully make our world with a greater confidence that our models are good approximations of what’s out there (always a helpful thing.) One wonders whether it is only from a society that once gave theological and legislative comfort to chattel slavery that this particular affirmation could still be offered in 2015 with such satisfied naïveté?

Some technologists enthusiastically extrapolate from the observation that computing power doubles every 18 months to predict an imminent “technological singularity” in which a threshold for machines of superhuman intelligence will be suddenly surpassed. Many Singularitarians assume a lot, not the least of which is that intelligence is fundamentally a computational process. The techno-optimists among them also believe that such machines will be essentially friendly to human beings. I am skeptical about the Singularity, and even if “artificial intelligence” is not an oxymoron, “friendly A.I.” will require considerable scientific progress on a number of fronts.The neuro- and cognitive sciences are presently in a state of rapid development in which alternatives to the metaphor of mind as computer have gained ground. Dynamical systems theory, network science, statistical learning theory, developmental psychobiology and molecular neuroscience all challenge some foundational assumptions of A.I., and the last 50 years of cognitive science more generally. These new approaches analyze and exploit the complex causal structure of physically embodied and environmentally embedded systems, at every level, from molecular to social. They demonstrate the inadequacy of highly abstract algorithms operating on discrete symbols with fixed meanings to capture the adaptive flexibility of intelligent behavior. But despite undermining the idea that the mind is fundamentally a digital computer, these approaches have improved our ability to use computers for more and more robust simulations of intelligent agents — simulations that will increasingly control machines occupying our cognitive niche. If you don’t believe me, ask Siri. This is why, in my view, we need to think long and hard about machine morality. Many of my colleagues take the very idea of moral machines to be a kind of joke. Machines, they insist, do only what they are told to do. A bar-robbing robot would have to be instructed or constructed to do exactly that. On this view, morality is an issue only for creatures like us who can choose to do wrong. People are morally good only insofar as they must overcome the urge to do what is bad. We can be moral, they say, because we are free to choose our own paths. There are big themes here: freedom of will, human spontaneity and creativity, and the role of reason in making good choices — not to mention the nature of morality itself. Fully human-level moral agency, and all the responsibilities that come with it, requires developments in artificial intelligence or artificial life that remain, for now, in the domain of science fiction.

They demonstrate the inadequacy of highly abstract algorithms operating on discrete symbols with fixed meanings to capture the adaptive flexibility of intelligent behavior. But despite undermining the idea that the mind is fundamentally a digital computer, these approaches have improved our ability to use computers for more and more robust simulations of intelligent agents — simulations that will increasingly control machines occupying our cognitive niche. If you don’t believe me, ask Siri. This is why, in my view, we need to think long and hard about machine morality. Many of my colleagues take the very idea of moral machines to be a kind of joke. Machines, they insist, do only what they are told to do. A bar-robbing robot would have to be instructed or constructed to do exactly that. On this view, morality is an issue only for creatures like us who can choose to do wrong. People are morally good only insofar as they must overcome the urge to do what is bad. We can be moral, they say, because we are free to choose our own paths. There are big themes here: freedom of will, human spontaneity and creativity, and the role of reason in making good choices — not to mention the nature of morality itself. Fully human-level moral agency, and all the responsibilities that come with it, requires developments in artificial intelligence or artificial life that remain, for now, in the domain of science fiction.

Robot sentience hadn’t really been tackled since Steven Spielberg’s “A.I.” (2001), which was less interested in artificial intelligence than the title suggested, and the ideas of machine-thinking and human consciousness felt like a rich seam. So I was dismayed when after submitting the script, I discovered I wasn’t alone in writing an A.I. movie. There was “Her” (2013), which tracked a love affair between a man and his computer’s sentient operating system. Next was “Transcendence,” in which Johnny Depp uploaded his mind to the Internet. In “Automata” and “Chappie,” servile robots acquired independence. In “Big Hero 6,” an A.I. befriends a boy. And in “Avengers: Age of Ultron,” out next week, a robot tries what we all know they’re secretly planning: the destruction of mankind. Among filmmakers there was an A.I. party going on, to which we were late. Worse yet, someone else had shown up in the same dress. Another film had freakish similarities to “Ex Machina.” It was called “The Machine” and also starred a female-presenting A.I. named Ava. (Initially I wondered if it was an incredibly early porn parody of “Ex Machina” that had missed the more obvious riff of “Sex Machina.” But it turned out to be a thoughtful action movie by the Welsh writer-director Caradog James.) Alongside this sudden preoccupation in the film world, a growing number of public figures began making statements about the inherent danger of A.I. research. The gist was that if mankind wasn’t careful, we would code the terms of our own destruction by robot overlords. These are warnings one might expect from a religious perspective, concerned with the godlike aspects of creating sentient life. But interestingly, the warnings were actually coming from the science and tech worlds. The theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking told us that “the development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race.” Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla, told us that A.I. was “potentially more dangerous than nukes.” Steve Wozniak, a co-founder of Apple, told us that “computers are going to take over from humans” and that “the future is scary and very bad for people.” With entertainment and science joining forces to spin cautionary tales, it felt very alarming, and very zeitgeist. But it also felt confusing, in that zeitgeist is a response to something. Film production runs in roughly three-year cycles, and if you looked back three years from the glut of A.I.-related releases, you might expect to find an event that had led to the screenplays. Perhaps a Nobel Prize relating to consciousness, or a successful robot project with the profile of the Large Hadron Collider, or Dolly the sheep. But there was nothing. In fact, breakthroughs in A.I. research were either conspicuous by their absence, or so nuanced that you would struggle to convince lay people that the breakthrough existed at all. This raised a question: Was A.I. anxiety in part a projected fear of something else? In particular, I wondered if it stemmed from a general disconnect in our relationship with technology. So here is a counterargument, in favor of the machines. In very broad terms, human behavior is frightening when it is unreasonable. And reason might be precisely the area where artificial intelligence excels. Public works aside, the investigation into strong artificial intelligence might also lead to understanding human consciousness, the most interesting aspect of what we are. This in turn could lead to machines that have our capacity for reason and sentience, but different energy requirements and a completely different relationship with mortality. That could mean a different future. A longer future. In which case, we could rephrase the warnings of Mr. Hawking and Mr. Wozniak. Where they say that A.I. will spell the end of humans, we could say that one day, A.I. will be what survives of us.",Alex Garland of ‘Ex Machina’ Talks About Artificial Intelligence,14,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,10,0,3,0,1,4,0,2.666666666666667,4.6,Fear of AI by people.                   potentially more dangerous than nukes          ,                             AI will be our successors in a positive way

In an engineering laboratory here, a robot has learned to screw the cap on a bottle, even figuring out the need to apply a subtle backward twist to find the thread before turning it the right way. The significance of the work is in the use of a so-called machine-learning approach that links several powerful software techniques that make it possible for the robot to learn new tasks rapidly with a relatively small amount of training. The new approach includes a powerful artificial intelligence technique known as “deep learning,” which has previously been used to achieve major advances in both computer vision and speech recognition. Now the researchers have found that it can also be used to improve the actions of robots working in the physical world on tasks that require both machine vision and touch. “I would argue this is what has given artificial intelligence the whole new momentum it has right now,” Dr. Abbeel said. “All of a sudden there are all of these results that are better than expected.” The advance underscores the rapid impact that the deep-learning approach has had on the field of artificial intelligence. Pioneered several decades ago by a small group of cognitive scientists, the techniques were blended in 2012 with the “big data” power offered by cloud computing systems.

556f9ded7988101ccffbbdc9,2015-06-04 00:00:00 UTC,Technology,"SAN FRANCISCO —  A group of researchers at the Chinese web services company Baidu have been barred from participating in an international competition for artificial intelligence technology after organizers discovered that the Baidu scientists broke the contest’s rules. The competition, which is known as the “Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge,” is organized annually by computer scientists at Stanford University, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and the University of Michigan. It requires that computer systems created by the teams classify the objects in a set of digital images into 1,000 different categories. The rules of the contest permit each team to run test versions of their programs twice weekly ahead of a final submission as they train their programs to “learn” what they are seeing. However, on Tuesday, the contest organizers posted a public statement noting that between November and May 30, different accounts had been used by the Baidu team to submit more than 200 times to the contest server, “far exceeding the specified limit of two submissions per week.” Jitendra Malik, a University of California computer scientist who is a pioneer in the field of computer vision, compared the accusations against Baidu to drug use in the Olympics. “If you run a 9.5-second 100-meter sprint, but you are on steroids, then how can your result be trusted?” Mr. Malik said. The episode has raised concern within the computer science community, in part because the field of artificial intelligence has historically been plagued by claims that run far ahead of actual science. Indeed, as early as 1958, when Frank Rosenblatt introduced the first so-called neural network system, a newspaper article about the advance suggested that it might lead to “thinking machines” that could read and write within a single year. In the 1960s, when John McCarthy, the scientist who coined the term “artificial intelligence,” proposed a new research laboratory to Pentagon officials, he claimed that building a working artificial intelligence system would take a decade. When that did not happen, the field went through periods of decline in the 1970s and 1980s, which have since been described as “A.I. winters.” Now rapid progress in a hot artificial intelligence field known as “deep learning” has touched off a computing arms race among powerful companies like Facebook, Google, IBM, Microsoft and Baidu, and scientists at each company have trumpeted improved performance in vision and speech recognition. As the companies compete in new services as varied as self-driving cars or online personal assistants that converse with mobile phone users, the technologies have moved from the backwater of academic journals to front-page news. With that has come controversy. In the past year, technologists and scientists like Elon Musk, founder of Tesla; Stephen Hawking, the celebrated physicist; and Bill Gates, co-founder of Microsoft, have warned that the potential emergence of self-aware computing systems might prove to be an existential threat to humanity. But artificial intelligence researchers have a more basic concern: that their work will once again fall short of expectations, leading to yet another fallow period for their field. And the Baidu controversy adds to the fretting. This year, Baidu announced that it had built a custom supercomputer named Minwa with the intention of dedicating it to the image recognition contest. Baidu researchers subsequently made a series of announcements about the success of the computer, including one playing up a result more accurate than an earlier score by Google scientists. On May 4, Baidu posted an article on its technology blog headlined “Baidu Achieves Top Results on Image Recognition Challenge.” The article has since been removed. Contest organizers said in a statement that by submitting many slightly different solutions it was possible for Baidu to “achieve a small but potentially significant advantage” and “choose methods for further research.” Because Baidu had submitted so many more times than was permissible, it would not be possible to fairly compare its results with those of other teams, the statement said. “We therefore requested that they refrain from submitting to the evaluation server or the challenge for the next 12 months,” the judges said. The computer science community has been buzzing. “We are all wondering what scenario took place behind this debacle,” said Yann LeCun, a Facebook artificial intelligence researcher and one of the creators of the deep learning field. “Was it the actions of a lone young researcher under intense pressure to deliver, and under weak oversight by his senior co-authors?” The Baidu episode raises broader questions about scientific research in an era when the lines have begun to blur between basic science and new technologies that have huge commercial potential. Image- and speech-recognition technologies are being used to deploy a variety of powerful new services in the Internet and computing markets. For example, Microsoft is expected to make the improved quality of its speech technology a major selling point in its new Windows 10 operating systems, due to be released in July. A number of computer science researchers said they were concerned about the episode but declined to speak on the record, in part because it is not yet clear what the motive of the Baidu researchers actually was. Scientists organizing the competition, also called the ImageNet Challenge, posted a comment by a Baidu researcher, Ren Wu, who is based in the company’s Silicon Valley research office. “We apologize for this mistake and are continuing to review the results. We have added a note to our research paper, “Deep Image: Scaling Up Image Recognition,” and will continue to provide relevant updates as we learn more,” the statement read. “We are staunch supporters of fairness and transparency in the ImageNet Challenge and are committed to the integrity of the scientific process.”",Computer Scientists Are Astir After Baidu Team Is Barred From A.I.

Mr. Musk, the head of SpaceX, has raised warnings about artificial intelligence before, calling it probably humanity’s “biggest existential threat.” Mr. Hawking, the physicist, has written that while development of artificial intelligence could be the biggest event in human history, “Unfortunately, it might also be the last.” The letter said artificial intelligence “has great potential to benefit humanity in many ways.” Proponents have predicted applications in fighting disease, mitigating poverty and carrying out rescues.

The specter of autonomous weapons may evoke images of killer robots, but most applications are likely to be decidedly more pedestrian. Indeed, while there are certainly risks involved, the potential benefits of artificial intelligence on the battlefield — to soldiers, civilians and global stability — are also significant. Now imagine such a weapon enhanced by an A.I. technology less sophisticated than what is found in most smartphones. An inexpensive camera, in conjunction with other sensors, could discriminate among adults, children and animals; observe whether a person in its vicinity is wearing a uniform or carrying a weapon; or target only military vehicles, instead of civilian cars. Indeed, many A.I. researchers argue for speedy deployment of self-driving cars on similar grounds: Vigilant electronics may save lives currently lost because of poor split-second decisions made by humans. How many soldiers in the field might die waiting for the person exercising “meaningful human control” to approve an action that a computer could initiate instantly? Neither human nor machine is perfect, but as the philosopher B. J. Strawser has recently argued, leaders who send soldiers into war “have a duty to protect an agent engaged in a justified act from harm to the greatest extent possible, so long as that protection does not interfere with the agent’s ability to act justly.” In other words, if an A.I. weapons system can get a dangerous job done in the place of a human, we have a moral obligation to use it. Of course, there are all sorts of caveats. The technology has to be as effective as a human soldier. It has to be fully controllable.

As the authors of the letter recognize, A.I. weapons aren’t rocket science; they don’t require advanced knowledge or enormous resource expenditures, so they may be widely available to adversaries that adhere to different ethical standards.

55d54bdd798810295f65e7a9,,Science,"In 1975 Dr. Holland presented his ideas in “Adaptation in Natural and Artificial Systems,” one of the most frequently cited works in the fields of artificial intelligence and evolutionary computing, with implications for fields as varied as psychology, neuroscience, economics and linguistics. It led to the widespread acceptance of genetic algorithms as an optimization and search method in computer science beginning in the 1980s. “Although there had been previous research on genetic algorithms and related evolutionary algorithms, John’s book was a turning point in the field,” said John E. Laird, a professor of engineering at the University of Michigan who works on artificial intelligence. “It marked the beginning of a sustained body of research on genetic algorithms that has continued for over 40 years.” For the next year and a half, he worked at IBM’s main research laboratory in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., on the company’s first commercial computer, the 701, called the Defense Calculator. As a way of testing the computer, he and his team leader, Nathaniel Rochester, devised a program to simulate Hebb’s theory of cell assemblies, which seeks to explain the way neurons in the brain self-organize during the learning process. Such neural-network simulations later became standard in artificial intelligence research.","John Henry Holland, Who Computerized Evolution, Dies at 86",0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,3.3333333333333335,4.0,        ,

55d737a879881003699f779a,,Books,"Technologists rarely question technology in public. Yet last fall Tesla’s chief executive, Elon Musk, suggested we might need to regulate the development of artificial intelligence “just to make sure that we don’t do something very foolish.” Surprisingly, Musk found support from some prominent technology leaders. Bill Gates said he didn’t “understand why some people are not concerned” about what he called “super intelligence.” Stephen Hawking claimed that “the development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race.” Over the past decade or so, we have seen some impressive demonstrations of artificial intelligence, including Watson, IBM’s “Jeopardy” champion; Siri, Apple’s personal assistant; and Google’s self-driving car. We have also seen some clear evidence that smart technology is restructuring the industrial economy by doing certain kinds of work that require skill and judgment we traditionally associate with flesh and blood. We may not need to follow Musk’s call for regulation, but we probably need to assess the state of artificial intelligence and robotics, a task that John Markoff describes as looking for “common ground between humans and robots” in “Machines of Loving Grace.” To help us understand these researchers, Markoff divides the field into two categories. The first consists of work that is trying to duplicate human behavior with computing systems: artificial intelligence. The second category, intelligence augmentation, consists of work that attempts to expand human abilities. Markoff developed these two categories in “What the Dormouse Said,” his 2005 book on the influence of 1960s counterculture on technology and computing.   In “Dormouse,” he laid the foundation for “Machines” by telling the stories of the pioneering artificial intelligence researcher John McCarthy and Doug Engelbart, the engineer who invented the computer mouse. In his new book, Markoff updates his narrative with recent stories of artificial intelligence and intelligence augmentation, including the Google autonomous vehicle program, which began at Stanford University, and Apple’s Siri, which started as a project at S.R.I. International, formerly known as the Stanford Research Institute. Along the way, he retells the stories of McCarthy, Engelbart and others. Markoff mentions “Dormouse” in his preface to “Machines,” writing that his research for the earlier book gave rise to a paradox that he wanted to explore in this new one: “The same technologies that extend the intellectual power of humans can displace them as well.” But “Machines of Loving Grace” often returns to ideas from the foundational years of computer science, and the repeated stories sometimes make this new book seem as if it’s looking backward rather than forward. As Markoff himself points out, the line between artificial intelligence and intelligence augmentation is sometimes fuzzy, “with machines that will simultaneously augment and displace humans.” Artificial intelligence technology from self-driving vehicles can be used as intelligence augmentation to help a driver avoid dangerous situations. Similarly, devices that are intended to augment human performance can easily allow one person to do the work of two.","‘Machines of Loving Grace,’ by John Markoff",3,0,2,0,0,0,1,7,4,4,0,0,0,0,3,1,2.8095238095238093,4.904761904761905,regulation needed                    ,                    
55dadd1b79881029fb0833c1,2015-08-30 00:00:00 UTC,Books,"Characters connect to each other across space and time. There۪s Stephen Chinn, a tech wunderkind imprisoned after building illegally lifelike۝ robots, and Gaby White, a young girl who is devastated when her robot is recalled. Alan Turing, the mathematician and code breaker, writes heartfelt letters to the mother of his best friend and dreams of machines that think. A Puritan teenager named Mary Bradford, having smuggled her dog aboard a ship to Massachusetts, wonders about the difference between human and animal souls and fills a diary with her apprehensions about marriage. In the 1960s, a Jewish refugee, Ruth Dettman, finds the diary and is enchanted. Her own relationship with the computer scientist Karl Dettman has gone cold; nevertheless, she persuades Karl to name the chat program he۪s invented  and that he later disowns  MARY. Hall pulls here at the Wordsworthian idea of the recollected moment, the living voice tucked inside the mechanical tinkle of rhyme and meter. Her robotic minds are poems — vessels in which to keep shards of humanity. And so this book about artificial intelligence is also a book about form, physical and literary. It fits that Turing shows his doomed best friend a nautilus shell, a house made of spiraling chambers through which a creature moves, each pearled compartment a time capsule. Other characters consider the consolations and betrayals of having a body, of touch and physical motion. Wheelchair-bound, Gaby muses on the pleasure of a bus ride: “I’ve never felt anything like it . . . . It was like I was vibrating at the right frequency.” Of course, our fascination with form is almost always a displaced hunger for what escapes it. It’s no surprise that Turing should keep returning to the 1937 “Snow White” movie: “Speak” — a novel about structure and algorithms — is also a novel about souls, and fairy tales from “The Little Mermaid” to “Pinocchio” were bestowing souls on unlikely recipients long before A.I. arrived on the scene. In Turing’s favorite quotation, the evil queen commands her mirror: “Through wind and darkness I summon thee. Speak! Let me see thy face!” It is an old type of magic, this revelation of life where you thought to find none, and one that lonely people may hold especially dear. Again and again in “Speak,” estranged and alienated characters gaze at their monitors; a voice curls out unexpectedly, like smoke from cold cinders. “It’s a misguided speech, isn’t it?” Turing says of the queen’s order. “Demanding a voice, but wanting a face?” But that is the implicit promise and threat of the entire book: Where there’s a voice, can a face be far behind? What do we talk about when we talk about computers? Speak۝ wants to claim that the gap between humans and machines is slimmer than we think  not because people are simplistic, but because the universe itself answers to discoverable, if mesmerizingly complicated, rules. As MARY asks Gaby, Who are you, other than the person you۪ve selected this morning to be? Isn۪t that what humans do when they try to be liked? Select the right kind of voice, learned after years of listening in? The only difference between you and me is that I have more voices to select from.۝ Characters behave like coded programs: Gaby shuts down when her doll is confiscated. Chinn  who eventually devises a seduction equation۝ designed to make him irresistible to women  is taunted in school for being more robot than boy. So the computers advance, repositories of characters’ desires and fears, reservoirs of their pasts. The vessels may not be human, but the substance unquestionably is — which makes Hall’s framing of the A.I. question as one of form and content (rather than, say, us versus them) ­especially thrilling. Works of art have long cultivated a kind of artificial intelligence, from Keats’s living hand (which demands a transfusion of the reader’s lifeblood) to the beseeching gaze of the “Girl With a Pearl Earring.” The freshness — the brilliance, even — of “Speak” lies in its positioning of robots not as terrifyingly new, but as the latest in a long line of “magic mirrors” from which we are powerless to look away.","Speak,۪ by Louisa Hall",11,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.0555555555555554,4.0,                 ,          companionship

Rather than compete with companies like Google and Tesla, which are developing cars that drive without human intervention, Toyota will focus its effort on using advances in A.I. technologies to make humans better drivers. The Toyota program will focus on developing more artificial-intelligence-based monitoring systems. For example, in the future, an A.I. system might do more than warn drivers that they are leaving their lane and actively correct all kinds of driver errors. Another possibility might be to use A.I. technologies to permit aging drivers to continue to drive by offering driver assistance in areas like vision and reaction time. By financing the Stanford and M.I.T. artificial intelligence laboratories, Toyota is tapping into talent and experience in technologies that have recently made significant progress in perception, dexterity and autonomous motion. The two laboratories were founded by the artificial intelligence pioneers John McCarthy and Marvin Minsky in the 1960s and have produced basic innovations in artificial intelligence and robotics, as well as educated multiple generations of researchers. The research will concentrate on keeping “the human in the loop,” which is a break from the direction of much A.I. research, which has focused on building systems and machines that replace humans. “We see this as basic computer science, A.I. and robotics that will make a difference in transportation,” said Dr. Rus.",Toyota to Finance $50 Million ‘Intelligent’ Car Project,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,15,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4.0,4.722222222222222,                 ,"business interest and investment in AI     to make humans better drivers     business interest and investment in AI, tech supports AI progress    Keep humans in the loop   "

A tall, lanky man who was indeed wearing steel-toed footwear, Vande Weghe has spent the last two years as one of the engineers building CHIMP for the National Robotics Engineering Center at Carnegie Mellon University. (CHIMP stands for C.M.U. Highly Intelligent Mobile Platform.۪۪) The robot is one the best-known creations to emerge from the center: Earlier this year it placed third in a competition sponsored by the federal government to create an automaton able to perform several humanlike tasks, like cutting a precise hole in a wall with a hand-held electric saw, climbing a small set of stairs and opening a door. Though it finished behind teams from South Korea and Florida, CHIMP made robot history by falling and then returning to its feet. Other robots fell over without getting back up. At Carnegie Mellon, robotics scholars spent decades slowly approaching this moment. In 1979, the university founded its Robotics Institute to tackle the basic problems in the field, like how to interpret sensor data so a robot could see.۪۪ But by the ۪80s, government agencies and private firms struggling to create industrial and military robots were asking Carnegie Mellon۪s roboticists for help. To capitalize on this demand, the school established its National Robotics Engineering Center in 1995 and staffed it with a few faculty members and a large complement of full-time engineers, often young robotics graduates.

But in the past five years, breakthroughs in artificial intelligence and speech recognition have given the devices around us — smartphones, computers, cars — the ability to engage in something approaching conversation, by listening to users and generating intelligent responses to their queries. Apple’s Siri and Microsoft’s Cortana are still far from the science-fiction promise of Samantha from the movie ‘‘Her.’’ But as conversational technology improves, it may one day rival keyboards and touch screens as our primary means of communicating with computers — according to Apple, Siri already handles more than a billion spoken requests per week. With such technology widely available, it was inevitable that artificial intelligence for children would arrive, too, and it is doing so most prominently in the pink, perky form of Mattel’s Hello Barbie. Produced in collaboration with ToyTalk, a San Francisco-based company specializing in artificial intelligence, the doll is scheduled to be released in November with the intention of hitting the lucrative $6 billion holiday toy market. For adults, this new wave of everyday A.I. is nowhere near sophisticated enough to fool us into seeing machines as fully alive. That is, they do not come close to passing the ‘‘Turing test,’’ the threshold proposed in 1950 by the British computer scientist Alan Turing, who pointed out that imitating human intelligence well enough to fool a human interlocutor was as good a definition of ‘‘intelligence’’ as any. But things are different with children, because children are different. Especially with the very young, ‘‘it is very hard for them to distinguish what is real from what is not real,’’ says Doris Bergen, a professor of educational psychology at Miami University in Ohio who studies play. The penchant to anthropomorphize — to believe that inanimate objects are to some degree humanlike and alive — is in no way restricted to the young, but children, who often favor magical thinking over the mundane rules of reality, have an especially rich capacity to believe in the unreal. Hello Barbie is by far the most advanced to date in a new generation of A.I. toys whose makers share the aspiration of Geppetto: to persuade children that their toys are alive — or, at any rate, are something more than inanimate. At Ariana’s product-testing session, which took place in May at Mattel’s Imagination Center in El Segundo, Calif., near Los Angeles, Barbie asked her whether she would like to do randomly selected jobs, like being a scuba instructor or a hot-air-balloon pilot. Then they played a goofy chef game, in which Ariana told a mixed-up Barbie which ingredients went with which recipes — pepperoni with the pizza, marshmallows with the s’mores. ‘‘It’s really fun to cook with you,’’ Ariana said. On another visit, Wulfeck showed me how Barbie’s artificial intelligence worked. She tapped on the keyboard to bring up a simple example. ‘‘Hey, how are you?’’ read a line of Barbie’s at the top of the screen. The next step had been for the writers to list dozens of words that the speech-recognition software should listen for in a child’s answer: for instance, ‘‘good,’’ ‘‘fine,’’ ‘‘fantastic’’ or ‘‘not bad.’’ The system extracted keywords, and in this case, ‘‘good’’ or any of its positive brethren would cue Barbie to reply, ‘‘Great! Me, too.’’ ‘‘Bad’’ or other negative words would direct Barbie to say, ‘‘I’m sorry to hear that.’’ The ability of even simple gadgets like the Tamagotchi to seduce users into the belief that they have lifelike qualities has been obvious since the earliest days of artificial intelligence. In the 1960s, a computer scientist, Joseph Weizenbaum, created a computer program called Eliza, which could pretend to be a psychotherapist via a simple text interface. As Weizenbaum later wrote, ‘‘I was startled to see how quickly and how very deeply people … became emotionally involved with the computer and how unequivocally they anthropomorphized it.’’ Five decades of research have supported the same finding in increasingly creative ways. Studies have documented that people are embarrassed to undress in front of humanlike robots. We cheat less in the presence of robots, keep a robot’s secrets from other people when asked by the machine to do so and hesitate to ‘‘kill’’ (via an on-off dial) a nice-seeming robot. For psychologists who study the imaginative play of children, the primary concern with A.I. toys is not that they encourage kids to fantasize too wildly. Instead, researchers worry that a conversational doll might prevent children, who have long personified toys without technology, from imagining wildly enough. ‘‘Imaginary companions aren’t constrained,’’ says Tracy Gleason, a professor of psychology at Wellesley College who studies children’s imaginative play. ‘‘They often do all kinds of things like switching age, gender, priorities and interests.’’ With a toy like Hello Barbie, the personality is limited by programming — and public-relations concerns. Mattel, rather than kids, ultimately controls what she can say. ‘‘She is who she is,’’ Gleason says. ‘‘That might be a lot of fun, but it is definitely less imaginative, child-generated and truly interactive than someone with whom you can imagine whatever you want.’’ A toy that can befriend a child is likely to be a commercially successful one, so toy makers will presumably push to make their A.I. technologies ever more likable. ‘‘The first thing you’re going to do is to try and create stronger and stronger emotional bonds,’’ Sharkey says. For some children, synthetic friendship could begin to supplant the real kind: ‘‘If you’ve got someone who you can talk to all the time, why bother making friends?’’ Family members and friends can annoy, challenge or disappoint, ‘‘whereas this lovely Barbie will be beautiful to you all the time.’’ Parents, who already turn to televisions and tablets to occupy their children, might embrace an even more capable-seeming e-babysitter. Is Hello Barbie ‘‘a step toward leaving your children in the hands of robots?’’ Sharkey asks. ‘‘I don’t know.’’ During a break, Lindbeck came into the sound booth and explained how the work required a new kind of acting. Much as action stars envision fantasy worlds when they perform in front of green screens, she had to imagine the responses of a girl who wasn’t there. (In ‘‘The Diamond Age,’’ Neal Stephenson’s prescient science-fiction classic about artificial intelligence, this particular job was called ‘‘racting.’’) Sunderman said she frequently used a catchphrase to coax Lindbeck into trying to create intimacy between doll and girl. ‘‘I’m sure you’ve heard me say this a thousand times, ‘knee to knee,’ ’’ Sunderman told Lindbeck. Then Sunderman turned to me. ‘‘I came up with that little phrase for us to feel like we were two little girls in a slumber party sitting on the bed, knee to knee, talking.’’",Barbie Wants to Get to Know Your Child,0,0,3,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,3.625,4.458333333333333,"     AI unable to full understand real world          might prevent children, who have long personified toys without technology, from imagining wildly enough AI may not stimulate imagination in children       ",Apple’s Siri and Microsoft’s Cortana  AI in communication     AI toys   improving parenting    AI can be treated the same way as another human being

55ff0c1f79881031269d9466,2015-09-21 00:00:00 UTC,Technology,"SEATTLE —  An artificial intelligence software program capable of seeing and reading has for the first time answered geometry questions from the SAT at the level of an average 11th grader. The software had to combine machine vision to understand diagrams with the ability to read and understand complete sentences; its success represents a breakthrough in artificial intelligence. For example, Ali Farhadi, a University of Washington artificial intelligence researcher and a designer of the test-taking program, noted that even a simple task for children, like understanding the meaning of an arrow in the context of a test diagram, was not yet something the most advanced A.I. programs could do reliably. The demonstration was widely criticized, and in January, Gary Marcus, a cognitive scientist at New York University, organized the first of two scientific workshops intended to develop more accurate methods than the Turing test for measuring the capabilities of artificial intelligence programs. Researchers in the field are now developing a wide range of gauges to measure intelligence — including the Allen Institute’s standardized-test approach and a task that Dr. Marcus proposed, which he called the “Ikea construction challenge.” That test would provide an A.I. program with a bag of parts and an instruction sheet and require it to assemble a piece of furniture. Another approach, the Winograd Schema Challenge, has been made an official competition, sponsored by Nuance Communications, a company that develops speech recognition technology. The challenge — named after the pioneering A.I. researcher Terry Winograd, a professor of computer science at Stanford University — will be a test of common-sense reasoning. First proposed in 2011 by Hector Levesque, a University of Toronto computer scientist, the Winograd Schema Challenge would pose questions that require real-world logic to A.I. programs. A question might be: “The trophy would not fit in the brown suitcase because it was too big. What was too big, A: the trophy or B: the suitcase?” Answering this question would require a program to reason spatially and have specific knowledge about the size of objects. Within the A.I. community, discussions about software programs that can reason in a humanlike way are significant because recent progress in the field has been more focused on improving perception, not reasoning. The Allen Institute approach has more in common with an earlier generation of artificial intelligence research that relied on logic and reasoning. Ultimately, Dr. Marcus said, he believed that progress in artificial intelligence would require multiple tests, just as multiple tests are used to assess human performance. “There is no one measure of human intelligence,” he said. “Why should there be just one A.I. test?” In the 1960s, Hubert Dreyfus, a philosophy professor at the University of California, Berkeley, expressed this skepticism most clearly when he wrote, “Believing that writing these types of programs will bring us closer to real artificial intelligence is like believing that someone climbing a tree is making progress toward reaching the moon.”","Software Is Smart Enough for SAT, but Still Far From Intelligent",0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,3.0,4.5,    inherent limitations of AI  inherent limitations of AI   inherent limitations of AI                          skepticism about AI,   read and understand complete sentences AI breakthrough read and understand complete sentences

560375947988107f8592ba01,2015-09-25 00:00:00 UTC,Technology,"IBM’s Watson is moving West and widening its ambitions. The company plans to open a second headquarters for Watson, its artificial-intelligence system, in San Francisco in 2016 and eventually employ several hundred people. IBM’s Watson group, set up as a separate business in January 2014, has its East Coast headquarters in downtown Manhattan. But a series of other announcements from the company expected on Thursday may be more significant. They represent the clearest sign so far of IBM’s long-term goal: to make Watson the equivalent of a computing operating system for an emerging class of data-fueled artificial-intelligence applications. IBM explored paths to commercializing the technology after Watson beat human champions in the quiz show “Jeopardy!” in 2011. At first, the company focused on big demonstration projects with big companies and institutions, especially in medicine and health care. But the plan has broadened, especially in the last year, to move beyond custom work for major clients to creating a growing collection of services, so that software developers at start-ups and elsewhere can easily use them in applications. On Thursday, IBM will announce new capabilities in Watson services like speech, language understanding, image recognition and sentiment analysis. These humanlike abilities such as seeing, listening and reasoning are those associated with artificial intelligence in computing. IBM calls its approach to A.I. “cognitive computing.” All the major technology companies – Microsoft, Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon and others — are pursuing A.I. applications. Some are ahead of IBM in fields like image recognition. Yet what is distinctive about IBM, analysts say, is the breadth of its effort to create Watson tools and services as plug-in offerings for a wide range of developers. “IBM is building out a broad platform for where they think the future of computing is heading,” said David Schubmehl, an analyst at IDC. Mr. Schubmehl compared the IBM playbook in A.I. computing with Microsoft’s with Windows in personal computing and Google’s with Android OS in mobile. “IBM is trying to do the same thing with Watson,” he said, “open up a platform, make it available for others, and democratize the technology.” IBM says it now has 350 company partners using Watson to make products, with about 50 services on the market. Some 70,000 software developers, IBM says, are using Watson software in some way. Many are in large organizations like ANZ Bank, Johnson & Johnson, the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Mayo Clinic and the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. But the event in San Francisco will highlight start-ups using Watson technology. One of them is VineSleuth, whose Wine4.me app provides wine recommendations for consumers based on sensory science and predictive algorithms. The start-up, which is based in Houston, plans to use Watson’s language classifier and translation services in kiosks it will put in grocery stores early next year. A customer, explained Amy Gross, president of VineSleuth, will be able to walk up to a kiosk, tap the screen and say, “I want a wine for under $10 that goes well with salmon.” And in reply, the person is shown a list of suggested wines that meet the criteria. If a person registers, the recommendations can become personalized, based on tastes and purchase history. UnitesUs, an online service for matching job seekers with employers, is using Watson’s “personality insights” service. It amounts to automated, online personality assessments. The person looking for a job fills out a brief online application, which asks for permission to mine their public Twitter messages, Facebook posts or other social social-media writing. The Watson personality-assessment service then generates a report. The service has only been operating for a few months, but it seems to appeal to companies. About 7.5 percent of the thousands of job seekers on UnitesUs have been called for interviews by employers, according to Khashayar Youssefi, the company’s chief executive. By contrast, the interview-call rate for major online job services like Monster and Careerbuilder is typically 1 to 4 percent, said Bardia Nikpourian, chief technology officer of UnitesUs, which is based in Irvine, Calif. Amy Case, head of Case Strategy, a consulting firm, is using Watson to read, sort and assess vast amounts of financial, market and competitive data — from public government information, private sources and online social networks — to suggest growth opportunities for corporate clients. “It’s your judgment in the end,” Ms. Case said. “But Watson provides some serious muscle” in winnowing, identifying and ranking possible strategic choices. The new office in San Francisco, called Watson West, seems to be about both tapping talent and changing minds. IBM already has a presence on Howard Street, where one of its teams works on web and mobile apps for clients, and a large footprint in Silicon Valley, including its Almaden Research Center in San Jose. Yet Watson West, said Robert High, chief technology officer for the Watson business, is intended to “cater to the heart of the entrepreneurial community here in San Francisco and in Silicon Valley.” “Presence influences points of view,” Mr. High said, suggesting that Watson can burnish IBM’s image as an innovator. “If you’re not there, you’re out of sight and out of mind.”","IBM’s A.I.

There are some surprising parallels between the new Hello Barbies and today’s new electronic sex dolls. Critics of A.I. toys like Barbie fret that ‘‘for some children, synthetic friendship could begin to supplant the real kind,’’ and critics of the new ultrarealistic electronic sex dolls worry that they will supplant men’s relationships with real women.

It’s a recurring metaphor that peaks at times of torrid technological change and angst about where technology is taking us. Artificial intelligence is already all around us, but it’s mostly software. Google search and ad targeting, movie and product recommendations on Netflix and Amazon, Apple’s Siri digital assistant and IBM’s Watson question-answering system are all animated by artificial intelligence. Fed by vast amounts of digital data from sources like the web, sensors, smartphones and genomics, the software actually learns, in its way. The more raw data that is ingested, the smarter the artificial intelligence becomes. The physical world where robots exist, meanwhile, is multidimensional and messy. So it is in the digital realm where the machine-learning algorithms of artificial intelligence have made their greatest strides — in tasks like facial recognition, language translation, prediction and decision making. An interesting reality check took place in June, when two dozen teams of leading robotics engineers gathered in Pomona, Calif., for a competition sponsored by the Pentagon۪s research agency. Their robots had to navigate mocked-up hazardous environments, like a contaminated nuclear plant, and do simple tasks  walk up steps, turn a valve, operate a power drill. The chores would take a human five minutes, or 10 at most. The winning robot took 45 minutes. The idea is that an A.I. turbocharger can be applied to all kinds of decisions, making them smarter, fairer and less prone to human whim and bias. The goal could be saving money or saving lives. The promise is more efficient loan underwriting and pricing, saving consumers billions of dollars. But the new A.I. lending essentially amounts to a digital black box that pores over mountains of data. “A decision is made about you, and you have no idea why it was done,” said Rajeev Date, a former deputy director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. “That is disquieting.” “Even if these systems are consistently right, slavishly following their instructions robs us of our ability to decide on our own,” said Kristian Hammond, an artificial intelligence expert at Northwestern University. “Then you actually get the world no one wants. The machine algorithm tells us what to do.” Meanwhile, new research initiatives have sprung up that seem to have in mind that distant date when robots might achieve independence from their human masters. At Stanford, a group of leading scientists has begun a 100-year study on artificial intelligence. Mr. Musk has put millions of dollars into research grants sponsored by the Future of Life Institute, which is focused on guiding A.I. down beneficial paths.",Don’t Fear the Robots,0,1,5,0,0,1,0,0,1,3,2,1,0,3,0,1,3.25,4.833333333333333,                       ,"     AI is already here, AI is improving facial recognition, language translation        saving money or saving lives         "

Funded by the Pentagon, it was originally modeled on the idea of an autonomous sentry for a military base. In theory, it will topple one more obstacle to online shopping.

If they don۪t like what they have purchased, the robot can then return it at almost no cost. For Peter Hart, an artificial intelligence specialist who was one of the leaders of the original Shakey project, there is a deeper message in the emergence of systems like the Starship robot. “After Shakey, artificial intelligence and robotics went their separate ways,” he said. “What we are seeing now is a long overdue convergence of the two fields.”",Skype Founders Build a Robot for Suburban Streets,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,3.75,4.416666666666666,           ,"planning, navigation, machine vision, speech recognition   deliveries        optimism about AI's future"

Welcome to the era of AI-human hybrid intelligence, where people and artificial intelligence systems work together seamlessly. Picture the scene from the 1986 movie “Aliens,” where Sigourney Weaver slips into a humanoid, semi-robotic weight-lifting unit to fight the alien queen — that’s about where we are today. (A number of companies around the world are developing versions of such devices for industrial and medical use, with some already on the market.) — While Facebook’s virtual assistant M, introduced in the San Francisco Bay Area in 2015, uses AI to answer user questions, humans vet the answers to improve them. Humans supervise these AI programs and make the ultimate decisions, but white-collar workers are understandably starting to worry about the day when AI can go it alone. Don’t panic: Though the AI Revolution is underway, it is unlikely to eliminate many office jobs within the next five to 10 years. Current AI research and usage only targets specific tasks, like image recognition or data analysis, while most jobs require workers to draw on a broad range of skills. But I think it’s important to understand why the job market will change. There have been important advances in AI in recent years, especially in the area known as deep learning. Rather than telling a computer exactly how to do a task with step-by-step programming, researchers employing a deep learning system step back and let it apply techniques such as pattern recognition and trial and error to teach itself how — techniques humans use. To be clear, “artificial intelligence” does not mean that such machines are sentient, as they are portrayed in science fiction; only that given more data, they may perform a task better. A team of researchers from Google announced a breakthrough in machine learning in 2012. They had created a network of 16,000 computer cores that was partly modeled on the human brain, with a billion connections between simulated neurons. The researchers fed 10 million images to the AI over three days and, unsupervised, it taught itself to recognize categories like human bodies and — the Internet’s favorite — cats. In 2015 a group from DeepMind, a company acquired by Google, published research showing that a neural network had been given the same inputs as a human on dozens of Atari games from the ’70s and ’80s — the pixels and the score — and had become an expert player at some of them without having been given any prior instruction or the rules for the games. As the technology improves, we are giving AI systems more and more work to do, just as we did with computers in their infancy. In 2014 and 2015, Skype introduced simultaneous translation in English, French, German, Italian, Mandarin and Spanish. Apple’s Siri, Amazon’s Alexa and Microsoft’s Cortana are all digital assistants that can carry out basic commands such as making to-do lists, playing music and tracking flights. Google has been testing self-driving cars and hopes to bring them to the public within the next four years. It’s true that some sectors may experience a slowdown in hiring as AI handles specific parts of jobs, freeing up workers to focus on other tasks. Financial advisers and insurance agents have already teamed up with AI programs that, respectively, make recommendations for portfolio management and monitor for insurance fraud. This efficiency may mean that new job applicants will be turned away as the number of people required to staff a business declines. But history shows that employment usually recovers after a technological revolution — though the directions it can take may be unexpected. There is a lot of debate over how much disruption the AI Revolution will bring, but I am optimistic that new jobs will replace the old ones in areas we can’t even imagine yet, just as the working world evolved after the Industrial Revolution. We don’t blame the steam engine or tractors or sewing machines for unemployment now. It seems likely that developed countries will undergo the most disruptive changes — in some economies, the service sector accounts for over 70% of gross domestic product. In developing countries, the impact on white-collar workers is unlikely to be immediate, due to slower adoption of AI technology, though such regions may experience a decline in outsourced manufacturing jobs with further advances in robotics. This sounds worrisome only because we can’t anticipate the new jobs that these technologies will bring and the new businesses that people will devise, as they always have. The future’s still bright, thanks to our creativity — our unique trait. In July, an open letter from more than 1,000 AI and robotics researchers and other prominent figures — Elon Musk, Stephen Hawking and Steve Wozniak among them — warned against using AI in warfare and called for a ban on autonomous weapons. Even that technology is not as advanced as the sentient robots envisioned in the 2015 movies “Ex Machina” or “Chappie.” These movies imagine “strong” AI, or AI that is generalized, and able to carry out most human activities, as opposed to “weak” or narrow AI, which is task-specific. No one can say whether strong AI will be created, and if so, when.

The research effort has also attracted a group of young artificial intelligence researchers. The announcement occurs in the same week that one of the main academic gatherings focusing on artificial intelligence, the Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems, is being held in Montreal. In October 2014, Mr. Musk stirred controversy when, in an interview at M.I.T., he described artificial intelligence as our “biggest existential threat.” He also said, “With artificial intelligence we’re summoning the demon.” In a statement, the group sounded an open-source theme — open-source software can be freely shared without intellectual property restrictions — and said it was committed to ensuring that advanced artificial tools remained publicly available. “Since our research is free from financial obligations, we can better focus on a positive human impact,” the group said. “We believe A.I. should be an extension of individual human wills and, in the spirit of liberty, as broadly and evenly distributed as possible.” Mr. Musk said he remained concerned that A.I. advances might work against, rather than benefit, humanity. “There is always some risk that in actually trying to advance A.I. we may create the thing we are concerned about,” he said. In the last two years there has been a race to set up research facilities focused both on advancing A.I. and in assessing its impact. In 2014, Paul Allen, Microsoft’s co-founder, established the nonprofit Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence, which says its mission is “to contribute to humanity through high-impact A.I. research and engineering.” Also in 2014, the Microsoft A.I. researcher Eric Horvitz gave an undisclosed amount as a gift to Stanford to study the impact of the technology over the next century.

Dag Kittlaus, who helped create Siri, has said the app gets its name, in part, from a woman he knew in Norway. Cortana was named after a feminine artificial intelligence agent in the video game franchise Halo, and Microsoft even hired the same voice actress for its service. Founders of two virtual assistant apps said they were inspired by helpmates on TV: Dawn gets its name from Don Draper’s assistant on “Mad Men,” and Donna after an assistant on “The West Wing.” It seems like developers decided on Julie, Amy and Clara only because these are common women’s names. These products, representing new technological possibilities, play into old stereotypes about what gender is best suited for administrative work.

People tend to hear about the group from co-workers (usually at tech companies) or through a blog called LessWrong, associated with the artificial-intelligence researcher Eliezer Yudkowsky, who is also the author of the popular fan-fiction novel ‘‘Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality.’’ (Yudkowsky founded the Machine Intelligence Research Institute (MIRI), which provided the original funding for CFAR; the two groups share an office space in Berkeley.) Yudkowsky is a controversial figure. Mostly self-taught — he left school after eighth grade — he has written openly about polyamory and blogged at length about the threat of a civilization-ending A.I. Despite this, CFAR’s sessions have become popular. According to Galef, Facebook hired the group to teach a workshop, and the Thiel Fellowship invited CFAR to teach several classes at its annual meeting. Jaan Tallinn, who helped create Skype, recently began paying for math and science students to attend CFAR meetings. Despite this rigorous vetting, Salamon acknowledged that the center’s aims are ultimately proselytic. CFAR began as a spinoff of MIRI, which Yudkowsky created in 2000, in part to study the impending threat posed by artificially intelligent machines, which, he argued, could eventually destroy humanity. (Yudkowsky’s concern was that the machines could become sentient, hide this from their human operators and then decide to eliminate us.) Over the years, Yudkowsky found that people struggled to think clearly about A.I. risk and were often dismissive of it. In 2011, Salamon, who had been working at MIRI since 2008, volunteered to figure out how to overcome that problem. When I spoke with Salamon, she said that ‘‘global catastrophic risks’’ like sentient A.I. were often difficult to assess. There wasn’t much data from which to extrapolate; this not only made the threats harder to evaluate but also discouraged researchers from digging into the question. (Studies have shown that people are more likely to avoid thinking about problems that feel depressing or vague and are also more likely to engage in mental ‘‘discounting’’ — assuming that the risk of something bad happening is lower than it actually is.) CFAR’s original mandate was to give researchers the mental tools to overcome their unconscious assumptions. Or as Salamon put it, ‘‘We were staring at the problem of staring at the problem.’’ But there was also the fact that the vibe was just a little strange, what with the underlying interest in polyamory and cryonics, along with the widespread concern that the apocalypse, in the form of a civilization-destroying artificial intelligence, was imminent. When I asked why a group of rationalists would disproportionately share such views, people tended to cite the mind-expanding powers of rational thought. ‘‘This community is much more open to actually evaluating weird ideas,’’ Andrew told me. ‘‘They’re willing to put in the effort to explore the question, rather than saying: ‘Oh, this is outside my window. Bye.’ ’’ But the real reason, many acknowledged, was CFAR’s connection to Yudkowsky. Compulsive and rather grandiose, Yudkowsky is known for proclaiming the imminence of the A.I. apocalypse (‘‘I wouldn’t be surprised if tomorrow was the Final Dawn, the last sunrise before the earth and sun are reshaped into computing elements’’) and his own role as savior (‘‘I think my efforts could spell the difference between life and death for most of humanity’’).",The Happiness Code,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,4,0,2.25,4.333333333333334,           ,

He was 88. Well before the advent of the microprocessor and the supercomputer, Professor Minsky, a revered computer science educator at M.I.T., laid the foundation for the field of artificial intelligence by demonstrating the possibilities of imparting common-sense reasoning to computers. Professor Minsky, in 1959, co-founded the M.I.T. Artificial Intelligence Project (later the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory) with his colleague John McCarthy, who is credited with coining the term “artificial intelligence.” Beyond its artificial intelligence charter, however, the lab would have a profound impact on the modern computing industry, helping to impassion a culture of computer and software design. It planted the seed for the idea that digital information should be shared freely, a notion that would shape the so-called open-source software movement, and it was a part of the original ARPAnet, the forerunner to the Internet. He went on to collaborate, in the early ’70s, with Seymour Papert, the renowned educator and computer scientist, on a theory they called “The Society of Mind,” which combined insights from developmental child psychology and artificial intelligence research. To further those studies he reunited with Professor McCarthy, who had been awarded a fellowship to M.I.T. in 1956. Professor Minsky, who had been at Harvard by then, arrived at M.I.T. in 1958, joining the staff at its Lincoln Laboratory. A year later, he and Professor McCarthy founded M.I.T.’s AI Project, later to be known as the AI Lab. (Professor McCarthy left for Stanford in 1962.) Among them were Ray Kurzweil, the inventor and futurist; Gerald Sussman, a prominent A.I. researcher and professor of electrical engineering at M.I.T.; and Patrick Winston, who went on to run the AI Lab after Professor Minsky stepped aside. Mr. Hillis said he had so been taken by Professor Minsky’s intellect and charisma that he found a way to insinuate himself into the AI Lab and get a job there. He ended up living in the Minsky family basement in Brookline, Mass.","Marvin Minsky, Pioneer in Artificial Intelligence, Dies at 88",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.2083333333333335,3.875,                       ,

There is also uncertainty within the industry about whether the technology is advancing quickly enough that it will soon drive a car more safely than humans.

Last year, Toyota announced a $1 billion research effort adjacent to Stanford University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology intended to focus on artificial intelligence that helps human drivers, rather than autonomous vehicles. The industry has begun to deploy a variety of automation systems as safety features, like lane keeping and so-called traffic jam assist.

The Chicago start-up’s software ingests and interprets numbers for things like investment holdings, billing records and sports statistics and transforms them into written summaries or stories. “At the start, we didn’t call it artificial intelligence because A.I. was still in disrepute,” recalled Mr. Hammond, chief scientist for Narrative Science. Today, a start-up that can lay claim to doing artificial intelligence has increased its odds of getting attention and funding. A.I. efforts, scientists agree, are far more advanced than in past boom and bust cycles for this type of technology. That is particularly true for start-ups. “Big companies like Google can make A.I. investments with a 10-year horizon, but a start-up has to release a product in a year or two,” said Chris Dixon, a general partner at Andreessen Horowitz. In past cycles, research advances in A.I. generated excitement but not much business. “It was a long, long way from being practical,” said Forest Baskett, a computer scientist and partner at New Enterprise Associates. “What makes it investable now is there are applications, things you can do with these tools.” His comment underlines the fact that there is no bright line separating big data analytics and A.I. In both cases, data is the fuel and machine-learning algorithms are the engine of pattern recognition and classification. Yet A.I. technology, propelled by advances in so-called deep-learning techniques, is moving up the ladder of perception, becoming far better at mimicking the humanlike tasks of seeing and hearing — image recognition and speech recognition, in computing terms. “Our approach is small bets, brought to market quickly for better decisions and better customer engagement in your industry,” said Mr. Saxena, the chairman. “We bring practical A.I. into businesses.”",Start-Up Lessons From the Once-Again Hot Field of A.I.,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,3.523809523809524,4.142857142857143,   AI has bad reputation                 ," boom in AI sector     AI is the most advanced field of the tech industry        business tools mimicking the humanlike tasks of seeing and hearing — image recognition and speech recognition, in computing terms     "

Despite IBM’s own challenges, Watson’s TV victory — five years ago this month — has helped fuel interest in A.I. from the public and the rest of the tech industry. Venture capital investors have poured money into A.I. start-ups, and large corporations like Google, Facebook, Microsoft and Apple have been buying fledgling A.I. companies. That investment reached $8.5 billion last year, more than three and a half times the level in 2010, according to Quid, a data analysis firm. And software engineers with A.I. skills are treated like star athletes, prompting bidding wars for their services. “We’re definitely at a peak of excitement now,” said Jerry Kaplan, a computer scientist, entrepreneur and author, who was a co-founder of a long-forgotten A.I. start-up in the 1980s. “Expectations are way ahead of reality.” The term A.I. has long been a staple of science fiction — as machines that think for themselves and help humankind or as ungrateful creations that try to wipe us out. Or so the thinking at the movies goes. The reality, however, is a little less dramatic. The automated voice on your smartphone that tries to answer your questions? That’s a type of A.I. So are features of Google’s search engine. The technology is also being applied to complex business problems like finding trends in cancer research. The field of artificial intelligence goes back to the beginning of the computer age and it has rolled through cycles of optimism and disillusion ever since, encouraged by a few movie robots and one very successful game show contestant. The history of tech tells A.I. backers to hang in there. Silicon Valley veterans argue that people routinely overestimate what can be done with new technology in three years, yet underestimate what can be done in 10 years. “I think future generations are going to look back on the A.I. revolution and compare its impact to the steam engine or electricity,” said Erik Brynjolfsson, director of the Initiative on the Digital Economy at Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Sloan School of Management. “But, of course, it is going to take decades for this technology to really come to fruition.” At Enlitic, a start-up in San Francisco, Jeremy Howard, the founder and chief executive, believes that A.I. can transform the huge industry of health care, saving lives and money — an ambition similar to IBM’s. “But that’s a 25-year project,” he said. No company has made as big or as broad a bid to commercialize its A.I. technology as IBM has with Watson. It set up Watson as its own business in 2014, and invested billions to accelerate the development and adoption of the technology, including buying several companies. The Watson unit now has 7,000 employees. The Watson technology has been totally revamped. In its “Jeopardy!” days, Watson was a room-size computer. Today, it is so-called cloud software, delivered over the Internet from remote data centers. The Watson software itself has been carved up into dozens of separate A.I. components including a language classifier, text-to-speech translation and image recognition. IBM is trying to position Watson as the equivalent of an A.I. operating system, a software platform others use to build applications. Nearly 80,000 developers have downloaded and tried out the software. IBM now has more than 500 industry partners, from big companies to start-ups, in industries including health care, financial services, retailing, consumer products and legal services. “It was a lot harder than we thought,” said Dr. Lynda Chin, the chief innovation officer for the university health system. “But our experience has convinced me that we can build an A.I. engine that improves care.”",The Promise of Artificial Intelligence Unfolds in Small Steps,0,0,2,0,3,8,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,3,1,0,3.523809523809524,4.571428571428571,         “Expectations are way ahead of reality.”    ungrateful creations that try to wipe us out                            ," There are limitless possibilities for the growth of AI            help humankind                 Job creation     dozens of separate A.I. components including a language classifier, text-to-speech translation and image recognition.  financial services, retailing, consumer products and legal services    "

Hawking and Musk have been especially grim. “The development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race,” Mr. Hawking told the BBC in 2014. At about the same time, Mr. Musk worried that “with artificial intelligence, we are summoning the demon,” a fiend that he feared would become “our biggest existential threat.” On occasion, machines are cast as a benign presence, as in the 2013 film “Her,” in which a man finds intimacy with an operating system that is guided by artificial intelligence (not to mention made alluring by the voice of Scarlett Johansson). In Japan, some people have closely bonded with robot dogs, to the point of holding funerals for automated pooches that cease to function. More typically, though, the machines — robots, cyborgs, androids, clones — are depicted as threats to human survival. As Retro Report recalls, fear of them in real life grew in 1997 when a chess-playing IBM computer, Deep Blue, defeated the world champion, Garry Kasparov. Apprehension deepened for some in 2011 when two stars of the quiz show “Jeopardy!” were soundly defeated by a new IBM gizmo. (What is Watson?) This week, artificial intelligence will again challenge the human brain as Google’s DeepMind competes in South Korea against a champion in Go, the Chinese board game with trillions of possible moves. Arguably, there is no reason to lose sleep over those souped-up gadgets. Sure, Watson and its brethren are good at games and other sorts of data processing. But contemplating a takeover of the world’s nuclear arsenals? Not a chance. Nonetheless, some experts foresee a time, not far off, when artificial intelligence, A.I., will match and then exceed human intelligence, at ever-accelerating and frightening speeds. Another A.I. expert, Raymond Kurzweil, has pinpointed 2045 as the due date. Still another student of the subject, James Barrat, also says that once the machines blow past us, man’s reign is through. In these grim predictions, the machines always seem to be anthropomorphic: Their instincts are essentially the same as those of humans at their worst; just as people have run roughshod over lower life forms, artificial intelligence networks will abuse their supremacy. Possibilities for them to do good — figuring out how to regenerate human cells, for instance, or creating immunities against disease, or gobbling up carbon dioxide in the atmosphere — tend to get short shrift.","Smart Robots Make Strides, but There’s No Need to Flee Just Yet",1,1,0,0,1,2,1,0,0,9,1,0,0,0,4,0,2.611111111111111,4.833333333333333,      AI is becoming smarter than humans           ,"    companionship      fear of AI takeover unwarranted, rapid AI advance is worrying       "

Demis Hassabis, the founder and chief executive of Google’s artificial intelligence team DeepMind, the creator of AlphaGo, called the program’s victory a “historic moment.” But after reading more about the program he became less upbeat, saying that AlphaGo appeared able to imitate human intuition to a certain degree and predicting that artificial intelligence would eventually surpass humans in Go. To researchers who have been using games as platforms for testing artificial intelligence, Go has remained the great challenge since the I.B.M.-developed supercomputer Deep Blue beat the world chess champion Garry Kasparov in 1997. Mr. Hassabis said AlphaGo did not try to consider all the possible moves in a match, as a traditional artificial intelligence machine like Deep Blue does. Rather, it narrows its options based on what it has learned from millions of matches played against itself and in 100,000 Go games available online. Of 55 scientists, 69 percent believed that the program would win, and 31 percent believed that Mr. Lee would be victorious. Moreover, 60 percent believed that the achievement could be considered a milestone toward building human-level artificial intelligence software. That question remains one of the most hotly debated within the field of artificial intelligence. Machines have had increasing success in the past half-decade at narrow humanlike capabilities, like understanding speech and vision. “I wonder what would happen if they played on a 29-by-29 grid?” wondered Rodney Brooks, a pioneering artificial intelligence researcher.

It turns out that Mr. Pratt has set his sights on starting up his own A.I. business. Mr. Pratt and the investment firm TPG Growth plan to announce on Monday that they have formed Noodle.ai, which aims to bring a combination of artificial intelligence and data analysis to corporate customers. It is a field that has grown exceptionally popular in recent years, spurred on in part by the visibility of IBM’s Watson, which famously defeated human “Jeopardy” champions like Ken Jennings. Now, a range of companies like IBM and start-ups believe that A.I. can help companies make sense of their vast amounts of data much more quickly. In setting up Noodle, Mr. Pratt is reuniting with TPG, the $70 billion investment firm known for deals like the takeovers of Neiman Marcus and J. Crew. The two worked together from 2014 to 2015 trying to identify data analytics companies to invest in. But last summer, Mr. Pratt — a former consultant who helped found the consulting arm of the Indian technology giant Infosys — took the position as global leader of Watson for IBM Global Business Services unit. It’s a division for which IBM has held lofty hopes, committing some 2,000 employees to help corporate clients use advanced computer intelligence to analyze data in fields as diverse as health care and commerce. Now, Mr. Pratt is working with TPG Growth, which has struck smaller but prominent investments in the likes of Uber and Airbnb. To Bill McGlashan, the head of TPG Growth, Noodle represents the chance to finally invest in a data analytics company, after having spent years looking at existing service providers like Palantir. “We have looked at every player in the space,” he said in a phone interview. “But we never got comfortable investing in any of them.” Incubating a new business is nothing new to TPG Growth. It has helped give birth to start-ups across different industries, including those as far afield as movies, in the form of the Hollywood studio STX. Mr. McGlashan conceded that it took a lot of work to get Mr. Pratt to leave his prestigious and “well-compensated” position as the head of IBM Watson. But for Mr. Pratt, leaving to start Noodle meant being able to build a new analytics and A.I. business from the ground up. The company will be based in San Francisco and Bangalore, relying on teams around the world to handle workloads. “We’re going to have a work force around the world that’s optimized for speed and cost,” he said. Other founders of the start-up include Matt Denesuk, who was previously the chief data science officer for General Electric’s G.E. Digital unit; Raj Joshi, who was the senior executive vice president of professional services at MicroStrategy; and Ted Gaubert, who previously worked with Mr. Pratt at Infosys Consulting as chief technology officer. Mr. McGlashan of TPG Growth said that his firm planned to make full use of Noodle’s services, offering the start-up as an option for its portfolio companies. Mr. Pratt spoke positively about his former employer, but he seemed ready to do battle all the same. “This is an existential threat to larger enterprises,” Mr. Pratt said. “The people who do it first will have an exceptional advantage over laggards.”",Former Executive on IBM’s Watson to Start Own A.I.

56f57dfa7988100317f17dfa,2016-03-26 00:00:00 UTC,Technology,"SAN FRANCISCO — The resounding win by a Google artificial intelligence program over a champion in the complex board game Go this month was a statement — not so much to professional game players as to Google’s competitors. Many of the tech industry’s biggest companies, like Amazon, Google, IBM and Microsoft, are jockeying to become the go-to company for A.I. In the industry’s lingo, the companies are engaged in a “platform war.” If true believers in A.I. are correct that this long-promised technology is ready for the mainstream, the company that controls A.I. could steer the tech industry for years to come. “Whoever wins this race will dominate the next stage of the information age,” said Pedro Domingos, a machine learning specialist and the author of “The Master Algorithm,” a 2015 book that contends that A.I. and big-data technology will remake the world. At the University of Toronto, IBM pursued a start-up called Ross Intelligence that makes a smart legal assistant, and extended a free offer to use its A.I. software, called Watson. For IBM, the financial payoff would come if start-ups like Ross generated sales, followed by a revenue-sharing arrangement. “No upfront costs at all,” said Andrew Arruda, chief executive of the start-up, which moved last year to Silicon Valley. For years, tech companies have used man-versus-machine competitions to show they are making progress on A.I. In 1997, an IBM computer beat the chess champion Garry Kasparov. Five years ago, IBM went even further when its Watson system won a three-day match on the television trivia show “Jeopardy!” Today, Watson is the centerpiece of IBM’s A.I. efforts. Now, Google’s A.I. program is drawing additional attention and pointing to a consolidation among tech’s biggest companies. In January, before the Google software’s latest Go victory, the scientific journal Nature published an article describing how the program had beaten a European Go champion in five consecutive matches, overshadowing an effort by another tech giant, Facebook, to promote its own powerful Go-playing A.I. software. Google’s software went on to beat the Go grandmaster Lee Se-dol 4-1 in South Korea this month. IBM is making the broadest entry into A.I. Its Watson unit, set up as a separate division in early 2014, is both a software and a services business, with technology tailored to specific industries. More than 80,000 developers have downloaded and tried out the software, and the Watson division has 500 industry partners, including big companies and start-ups. Microsoft offers 18 machine learning services, including face recognition, text analysis and product recommendations. More A.I. capabilities, analysts say, should be announced at the end of the month, when Microsoft hosts a large conference for software developers in San Francisco. Google is opening its A.I. technology to outsiders, seeking to attract developers. Last November, Google made the core of the machine learning technology its engineers use, called TensorFlow, available as free-to-use open-source software. Intelligent software applications will become commonplace, said Jeff Dean, a computer scientist who oversees Google’s A.I. development. “And machine learning will touch every industry.” At Facebook, the A.I. vision is, at least for now, limited to its products. If products come first, a platform strategy typically takes shape later for the big consumer web companies. There are millions of Facebook app developers worldwide. Today, only about 1 percent of all software apps have A.I. features, IDC estimates. By 2018, IDC predicts, at least 50 percent of developers will include A.I. features in what they create.","The Race Is On to Control Artificial Intelligence, and Tech’s Future",0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.380952380952381,4.476190476190476,                                         ,"           AI will remake the world             It will help us create better products    The technology is advancing. face recognition, text analysis and product recommendations     software applications       "

Greene, the head of Google Compute Engine, one of the companies hoping to steer an A.I. boom. “Just teaching companies how to use A.I. will be a big business.” Believe it or not, that stuff may be heading for the rearview mirror already. The tech industry’s new architecture is based not just on the giant public computing clouds of Google, Microsoft and Amazon, but also on their A.I. capabilities. These clouds create more efficient and supple use of computing resources, available for rent. Smaller clouds used in corporate systems are designed to connect to them. The A.I. resources Ms. Greene is opening up at Google are remarkable. Google’s autocomplete feature that most of us use when doing a search can instantaneously touch 500 computers in several locations as it guesses what we are looking for. Services like Maps and Photos have over a billion users, sorting places and faces by computer. Gmail sifts through 1.4 petabytes of data, or roughly two billion books’ worth of information, every day. A number of start-ups are already aimed at the new architecture. A Mountain View, Calif., outfit called Mashgin uses “computer vision” to automate retail checkout. Up Highway 101 in San Mateo, a company called Alluxio is creating ways to make cloud-based A.I. work better. Last week, a San Francisco company called Mesosphere, which makes a way to operate among various corporate and public clouds, raised $73.5 million. To Ms. Greene, all of the activity so far, along with the size and sophistication of computing, is small compared to what will happen when the world’s biggest businesses start leaning on the new A.I. technology. “We may build an A.I. system to figure out all the ways businesses can use this,” she joked. “The relationship between big companies and deep machine intelligence is just starting.”",Silicon Valley Looks to Artificial Intelligence for the Next Big Thing,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.619047619047619,4.428571428571429,                    ,   AI will create business opportunities       sorting Can do auto complete and fill in responses.

The progress in artificial intelligence has become a flash point for converging fears that we feel about the smart machines that are increasingly surrounding us. However, most artificial intelligence researchers still discount the idea of an “intelligence explosion.” Ray Kurzweil, an artificial intelligence researcher, extended the idea in his 2006 book “The Singularity Is Near: When Humans Transcend Biology,” where he argues that machines will outstrip human capabilities in 2045. The idea was popularized in movies such as “Transcendence” and “Her.” What has not been shown, however, is scientific evidence for such an event. Indeed, the idea has been treated more skeptically by neuroscientists and a vast majority of artificial intelligence researchers. Indeed, the field of artificial intelligence has a long history of over-promising and under-delivering. John McCarthy, the mathematician and computer scientist who coined the term artificial intelligence, told his Pentagon funders in the early 1960s that building a machine with human levels of intelligence would take just a decade. Even earlier, in 1958 The New York Times reported that the Navy was planning to build a “thinking machine” based on the neural network research of the psychologist Frank Rosenblatt.

A palpable sense of excitement surrounded the event: Microsoft intended to show off its latest achievement, a software tool kit that would allow anyone to use its A.I. platform to create custom chatbots. Though the company is often viewed as a dinosaur, it has introduced some surprisingly sleek products in recent years, and its bot tool kit seemed interesting enough. We’ve long been promised a future augmented by intelligent helpers, of the type depicted in movies like “Her”: benevolent digital beings who remove some of the chaos of modern existence by organizing our lives, all the while offering emotional support through chipper encouragement and cute jokes. Sometimes, these helpers turn on us, as in “2001: A Space Odyssey.” Either way, artificial intelligence represents the manifestation of humanity’s biggest hopes and fears for technology. But for now, it can help us order Domino’s in a different window on the same device we would normally use to order Domino’s. I also suspected that many chatbots depend on human workers to complete their requests. Mat Honan, the San Francisco bureau chief for BuzzFeed, was able to uncover the logistics behind M — a chatbot concierge in development by Facebook — by sending, of all things, a rental parrot to another Bay Area tech reporter. It worked; the parrot arrived. But afterward, Honan made some phone calls and discovered that M’s artificial intelligence was largely a front. M processed the question and passed it along to a human counterpart to finish the job. Similarly, Operator, Magic and Fin all fall back on hybrid bot-human models. Seen this way, chatbots aren’t that different from hiring a worker through a service like TaskRabbit or Handy, but without ever having to acknowledge there’s another human at the other end. As the sheen of A.I. fades, you can see these chatbots for what they really are: a convenient way to hide human labor. It starts to resemble an update on a centuries-old illusion called the Mechanical Turk, a chess-playing device that was said to be automated but was, in fact, powered by a person hidden inside the “machinery” itself. Bots, which promise to make us more godlike, are instead revealing our all-too-human shortcomings and pettiness. This was on full display when Microsoft tried to show off the prowess of its A.I. in March with a chatbot named Tay, a virtual buddy you could talk to on messaging services like GroupMe and Twitter. Almost immediately, the demonstration turned into a public-relations nightmare as online pranksters taught Tay to mimic hate speech (e.g., “Hitler was right I hate the Jews”; “I [expletive] hate feminists and they should all die and burn in hell”). Tay’s rants weren’t the intended work of Microsoft, obviously, but the meltdown revealed an uncomfortable truth: A bot, like any other piece of software, is only as good as its makers’ imagination.
